<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="r5">

<p>The life of John Kelly, written without partisan
bias, and to promote no other object but the vindication
of the truth of history, is presented to the reader in
the following pages.</p>

<p>The narrative is associated with three great epochs
in American history, in each of which John Kelly has
acted a prominent and conservative part. If he appears
in the foreground of the picture which the author
has attempted to sketch of those epochs, it is because
no true history of them can be written without according
to him such a place. He was the champion of
civil and religious liberty during the era of Know-Nothingism,
and contributed as powerfully to the
overthrow of the Know-Nothing party as any man in
the United States, with the single exception of Henry
A. Wise, of Virginia, who slew the monster outright.</p>

<p>In the fierce war between Barnburner and Hunker,
and Hard Shell and Soft Shell Democrats, which broke
out in 1848, and continued to rage throughout the
State of New York with intense bitterness for eight
years, John Kelly, in 1856, played the conspicuous
part of pacificator both in the State and National
Conventions of his party. The re-union which then
took place between the Hards and Softs resulted in
the nomination of Buchanan and Breckenridge at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
Cincinnati, who were elected President and Vice-President
of the United States.</p>

<p>The third epoch covers the contest with the Tweed
Ring, and the expulsion of the Ring from Tammany
Hall in 1872, when the Reformers were led by John
Kelly. Grand Sachem Tweed had to give place to
Grand Sachem Augustus Schell; and Sachems Peter
B. Sweeny, A. Oakey Hall, and Richard B. Connolly
were succeeded by Sachems Horatio Seymour, Samuel
J. Tilden and John Kelly. It was not merely a
change, but a revolution.</p>

<p>To achieve the results reached in 1872, and in the
few years immediately following, a leader of consummate
power was necessary. Honesty, courage, and
sagacity in the highest degree were required in that
leader. A man of action—not a visionary in the closet,
was what the times demanded. Upon John Kelly,
who sought not the position, but had it thrust upon
him, then devolved the leadership of the Democratic
party in New York. The events of that period have
passed into history, and although there were some who
at the time called Kelly a dictator, posterity will be
more apt to remember him as a benefactor.</p>

<p>For years the subject of this memoir has been the
target of calumny and misrepresentation. His whole
life from childhood to the present hour is here laid
before the reader, as the best answer to his maligners.</p>

</div>

<hr class="r15">

<p>The author has been at much pains to procure
good pictures of Mr. Kelly. The caricaturists have
taken so many liberties with his face, and presented it
in so many ridiculous lights, that public curiosity is
felt in every part of the United States to know exactly
how John Kelly does look <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propria persona</i>. To
gratify this curiosity the book has been embellished by
three excellent likenesses of Mr. Kelly, taken at the
ages respectively of thirty-five, fifty, and fifty-eight.
To Mr. Edward Bierstadt, whose picture of President
Garfield has been much admired, the reproduction in
artotype of the pictures for this volume was intrusted.
Fine engravings were used to get the likeness, and the
artotypist has executed his work with great success.</p>

</div>

<hr class="r15">

<p>John Kelly is the best abused man in America.
Fifty or sixty years ago Andrew Jackson was subjected
to similar treatment. The hero of New Orleans
lived down the slanders which were hurled thick and
fast upon him by political opponents. Mr. Kelly will
do the same thing, for the people, though easily imposed
upon for the moment by artful men, soon
correct their own misconceptions, and invariably render
justice to public characters. The malice which
invents slanders is incapable of transmitting them into
history.</p>

<p>Fugitive and imperfect sketches of John Kelly’s
career have appeared from time to time in the newspapers.
No detailed narrative of his life has hitherto
been submitted to the public. The writer of these
pages is conscious of the difficulty of portraying the
character of a living man. Appreciation of merit
should not run into panegyric; condemnation of
faults should not be spared where faults are found.
The advantages possessed by the present writer to
discharge the task he has undertaken have been
derived from an acquaintance with Mr. Kelly extending
over thirty years, and from participation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
public affairs in which that gentleman has been a
conspicuous actor. Mr. Kelly has figured in transactions
which will form an interesting chapter in the
history of the present times. The testimony of a
contemporary who preserves a distinct recollection of
the events he describes will always be an aid to the
historian of the next age, who must sift evidence in
order to get at the truth, and who should reject whatever
falls below that standard. There would not be
so many fictions in American biography, if those who
have participated in the scenes would record their
honest recollection of them. The testimony of an
eye-witness is in the nature of primary evidence, and
the historian can have no more helpful auxiliary than
such a reminiscent. The following pages are offered
to the public as the contribution to American biography
of one who has enjoyed unusual advantages of
knowing the man he writes about.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly is one of the few remarkable men the
present political generation has produced. The public
has read so much about him both of pure fiction and
coarse abuse, that an outline sketch of his life will no
doubt prove acceptable to candid readers, and furnish,
at the same time, a corrective of current misrepresentations.
It might seem strange to those who do not
stop to consider the causes of it, that a life-long citizen
of New York, who has acted a prominent part in its
affairs, should have come to be misunderstood by so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
many people. But to those who look into the matter
more closely the explanation is not difficult to find.
Mr. Kelly is a man of very positive character. He
has antagonized powerful men, and on several memorable
occasions thwarted their schemes of ambition
and self-aggrandizement. He has thus excited resentments,
and in their disappointment his opponents
have sought revenge. Some of these gentlemen control
great combinations of corporate wealth, and possess
enormous private fortunes. They have not found
it difficult to enlist a large section of the press into a
species of anti-Kelly crusade. The weapons of partisan
warfare are not very choice, and this crusade has
been carried on without much regard to the amenities
of journalism, but with a resolute and persistent attention
to the main idea, namely, the elimination of Mr.
Kelly as a political leader, by proclaiming him to be
the representative of one of the worst elements of
American politics. But this mode of attack, while it
may answer a temporary purpose, is always in the end
a weak one. Intelligent people become interested
to know more of a man who excites his opponents
into storms of abuse, torrents of invective, and hurricanes,
as it were, of rage. Is it all real, or does it
cover a purpose? That becomes the question which
the public soon ask, and its answer is always favorable
to truth, and fatal to the manipulators of an
artificial excitement, for intelligent people have an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
independent way of getting at the truth the moment
they suspect it is being kept back, and get at it they
will, and they do.</p>

<p>In this manner John Kelly’s political opponents
have really done him a service. The universal gaze
has been directed towards the man, and the monster
painted by reckless partisans of other and rival politicians
has been found to be no monster at all, but a
plain, quiet man, honest and straightforward as old
Nat. Macon himself—to whom he was once likened by
the late Alexander H. Stephens—of very original and
rugged order of mind, of powers of command scarcely
equalled by any other statesmen in the United States
to-day, a foe to humbug, a terror to corruptionists—one,
in short, to inspire love and respect rather than
hatred and ill-will in the minds of disinterested people.</p>

<p>The writer thinks he knows John Kelly intimately
and thoroughly. His mind is powerful, without the
acuteness of a Calhoun, or the imagination of a Webster,
but as far as he sees his objects he sees with
the eye of a statesman, and no judgment was ever
sounder. Of ideas in their simplicity men in general
have but a partial cognition, an apperception of consciousness,
as philosophers term it, and not the clear
perception. But the perceptive faculty is Mr. Kelly’s
pre-eminent feature. He is deliberate in mental
operation, trusting nothing to fancy or imagination,
and not distinguished for impulsive celerity of action,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
but almost invariably sure in his conclusions. Thus
it has been sometimes, that his plans, when suddenly
deranged in action by unforeseen circumstances, were
not rapidly reformed, and defeat came upon him.
But when he is in rest, and left to himself to devise
and map out movements, his judicious arrangement
and skill in deciding upon what is best to do have
proved almost faultless. Incapable of fear, he has
seemed to some to go forward to his objects with
blind obstinacy. But those who think so have
a superficial knowledge of the man, for prudence
is his controlling quality. Before he reaches a
decision, every circumstance and consideration is
maturely weighed, all suggestions are patiently
heard, all doubts exert restraint upon him. Indeed,
his prudence has exposed him to the charge by
more hot-headed men of being a plodder, so carefully
does he labor to mature plans. It is only when
he has reached a decision that his purpose becomes
fixed and immovable, and he goes through with it, no
matter what obstacles beset his path, or what less
courageous friends may advise to change his resolution.
Mr. Kelly has, in fine, granite firmness, and
there is a broad distinction between firmness and
doggedness.</p>

<p>Nature has given him a high temper, but reflection
and habits of self-command have reduced it to almost
perfect subjection. If aroused, however, and goaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
to passion, he is one of the most tremendous men in
his wrath, and one of the most formidable in his
mode of delivering battle. A man of warm affections
and commanding presence, his personal magnetism
is simply wonderful. His name, wherever he is
well-known, is never mentioned at public meetings
without storms of applause immediately breaking
forth. His appearance at public gatherings is always
the signal for hand clapping and expressions of welcome
of that unmistakable sort only bestowed on a
favorite. In this respect John Kelly almost rivals
Henry Clay, and since the death of the illustrious
Mill Boy of the Slashes no other man in America has
had such an enthusiastic personal following.</p>

<p>While his liberality is great it is unpretentious.
Publicity in well-doing is repulsive to his nature.
His charity, which is almost ceaseless, is consequently
always silent. The solidest kind of man in build
and character, he delights in action more than words,
and is known in New York as the safe leader. His
natural ascendency over men is instinctively recognized.
For these and kindred qualities his influence
in American politics is as potent as that of any other
statesman in public life, and the reader of the following
pages will find, it is believed, that this influence
has been always beneficially exerted.</p>

<p>John Kelly was born in the city of New York,
April 20, 1822. The home of his parents and spot of
his nativity was in Hester Street near Mott, in the
old Sixth, afterwards changed into the Fourteenth
Ward, famous for its politicians. He springs from
that stalwart race of men who have played so conspicuous
a part in the history of the United States—Tyrone
County Irishmen. From Tyrone County came
Richard Montgomery, whom Bancroft places second
only to Washington as the military genius of the
Revolutionary War; thence also came Alexander Porter,
the illustrious Louisiana statesman, and one of the
great lights of the United States Senate in its palmiest
days. Archbishop Hughes, who left his impress on
the age in which he lived as one of its most remarkable
men, and General James Shields, one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
heroes of two American wars, who enjoyed the unprecedented
distinction of having been elected to the
United States Senate at various times by three great
States of the Union, were both emigrants from Tyrone
County, Ireland. Out of this Milesian hive, seeking
his fortunes in the New World in the early part of
the present century, came Hugh Kelly, father of the
subject of this memoir. He married Sarah Donnelly,
of County Fermanagh, a small county adjoining Tyrone.
The marriage took place in Ireland. There
were seven children born to the parents, of whom
John was the fourth. The others were five daughters
and a son, the last named after the father, Hugh.
Old New Yorkers, who were acquainted with the
mother of John Kelly, have informed the writer of
this memoir that she was a woman of remarkable force
of character, a devout Christian, and a mother who
brought up her children in the love and fear of God.
The children were all vivacious, and very communicative
among themselves in the family circle, with the
exception of John, who was quiet and thoughtful,
and a better listener than talker. On one occasion a
neighbor paid a visit to the Kellys, and brought news
of an excursion, a pic-nic, or some such affair, that
pleased and greatly excited the little ones, each of
whom, save John, had something to say about it. At
length the neighbor looked over at John, who had
remained a silent listener, and exclaimed, “Look at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
John there, with his big head, taking it all in, and
not saying a word.” “Oh, yes,” said the mother,
“that is his way; he thinks a great deal more than he
talks, but be sure he is not dumb.” A New York
newspaper once cynically characterized him as an ox,
but the dumb ox, to use the figure of Albertus Magnus,
has given a bellow which has been heard round the
world. The devotion of Mrs. Kelly to her elder son
was peculiarly tender. At one time, when he was a
small boy, he had to cross the East River daily. The
mother would often accompany him to the boat in the
morning, and always went to meet him on his return
in the afternoon. Other boys going and returning at
the same time observed that young Kelly’s mother
never failed to be at the landing in the afternoon to
accompany her son home. The mischievous boys
sometimes cracked jokes at his expense, and teased
him about his mother’s apron strings. He stood the
bantering well enough for a time, but at length grew
tired of it. One of the tallest and strongest of the
boys hearing that Kelly had threatened to thrash the
next fellow that annoyed him on the subject, took
it into his head to try his mettle. “Say, Kelly,” exclaimed
this one, “how’s your mother? Boys, he’s
got a good mother, sure. She won’t let him go running
about the streets with the gang for fear he might
learn something wicked, but comes for him and takes
her little boy home every night. Come along, Johnny,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
and be tucked in your little bed. Bah!” A flushed
face and clenched fist told that Kelly would stand no
more raillery of that sort. A smart battle took place
on the spot between the two youngsters, and ended in
the discomfiture of the larger boy. Kelly’s victory
made him a favorite among his companions, and they
all soon came to look upon him as a sort of leader,
although he would not loiter with the crowd at street
corners of evenings, nor haunt the purlieus of the city
where youth loses its innocence, and flaunting vice
slopes the way to ruin. Such a mother is a guardian
angel to her children, and Mrs. Kelly’s afternoon escort
to her son provoked no more jibes at the expense of
the latter. This incident affords an insight into the
methods of his boyhood, and shows how, under the
fostering hand of his mother, the character of the
future man was moulded. The American sin of cursing
and swearing is first picked up by children running
idly about the streets into all sorts of company. John
Kelly was never addicted to this bad habit, and it may
be doubted whether his most intimate friend of to-day
ever heard him utter a profane oath. The Psalmist’s
aspiration to walk soberly and chastely in the day before
the Divine Face should be the aim of the rising
generation. With that object in view children should
be kept out of temptation in the pitfalls of a great
city. After awhile, when the habits of a promising
youth are formed on the right side, temptation assails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
him in vain, and whether it be from the cot of poverty
or the mansion of wealth, a hero steps forth for life’s
battle, who may be depended upon to make his way,
and render a good account of himself.</p>

<p>In the case of young Kelly, it was from the cot of
poverty he emerged. His father’s and mother’s business
of a small retail grocery store afforded the family
a modest but comfortable living. But while John was
still a small boy of eight years his father died, and
the widow and her elder son had to become the
bread-winners—the former managing the store, and
the latter, when about ten years old, going out in
quest of employment. John had attended for some
two or three years the parochial school attached to old
St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Mott Street. Now he had
to give up the school and go to work. It was a sore
trial to him, for he was ambitious of book learning,
and the dream of his life was to get a good education.
But he started out with a brave resolution to seek
employment. For a long time the search was tedious
and unsuccessful. He had to take many surly replies
from ill-bred people, and often went home tired at
night after a fruitless day’s rounds, to begin the work
over again in the morning. But he told his disappointments
to no one, unless indeed to whisper them
to the fond mother whose strong heart went out in
such sympathy with his own, and whose sound practical
sense helped him to form some new plan for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
morrow. It is probable that the lesson he learned
then of “man’s inhumanity to man” during his first
humble trials to make his way in life was never forgotten.
When the day came for himself to mount to
power, and to be called upon by many young and old
seeking a friendly hand to help them to their feet,
John Kelly proved to be a real philanthropist, uttering
the gentle word, cheering the drooping heart by
the overflowing generosity and charity of his own,
and never allowing a human being to pass out of his
doorway without feeling better and stronger for having
carried his sorrow to him.</p>

<p>One day John went into the <cite>Herald</cite> office, then in
its infancy, and asked James Gordon Bennett whether
he wanted an office boy. Mr. Bennett scanned the
boy over from head to foot without making a reply.
Seemingly satisfied with the first scrutiny, he began a
conversation with him, which continued for five or
ten minutes. There was no better judge of character
than the elder Bennett, and he was always quick in
making a decision. “Come in here, my lad, and take
off your hat and get to work,” said he, and John
Kelly found himself an employé forthwith of the
great editor. No two men have ever made their
mark more thoroughly in the metropolis of the United
States than James Gordon Bennett and John Kelly.
Did the editor descry in that first glance at the boy
the latent powers which ultimately have made Kelly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
so distinguished? “It is said,” remarked the editor
of the <cite>Utica Observer</cite>, in a notice of Mr. John Kelly
in that paper, “that old James Gordon Bennett took
a great fancy to him. This speaks much in his praise,
for the founder of the <cite>Herald</cite> was quick to see the
possibilities of greatness or usefulness in an undeveloped
youth.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Evening schools then but recently had been established
in New York, and the youth was quick to avail
himself of the advantages they afforded to boys in his
situation for acquiring an education. He became a
regular attendant at one of those night schools,
was a diligent and close student, and, like the great
Sir Thomas More, “rather greedily devoured than
leisurely chewed his grammar rules.” The editor of
the <cite>Utica Observer</cite>, one of Mr. Kelly’s most energetic
opponents and Governor Robinson’s ablest advocate
in the press, during the celebrated New York gubernatorial
struggle of 1879, declared of Kelly, in the
heat of that campaign, and in an article containing
an attack upon him, “that there is a great deal
to admire in the character of John Kelly.” Of his
education the editor added: “His thirst for learning
had not been satisfied in his youth, and he proceeded
by study to enlarge the scope of his understanding.
He became a good scholar in French, as well as in
English, and for twenty years he has devoted several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
hours of every day to the pursuit of literature and
science. If anybody has imbibed the impression that
Mr. Kelly is an ignorant man, he does not want to
confront that delusion with an actual examination of
Mr. Kelly’s acquirements. A Utica man who met
him once in the presence of Prof. Bonamy Price, of
Oxford, says that he held his own in a discussion on
Political Economy with England’s foremost teacher
of that science.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He proved to be an excellent
office-boy, was always at his post, and was as punctual
as the clock in fulfilling engagements. He
became a great favorite with Mr. Bennett, and
when, at length, as he grew older he resolved to
give up his employment in the <cite>Herald</cite> office
in order to learn some regular business or trade,
Mr. Bennett tried to dissuade him from his purpose,
and offered additional compensation as an inducement
for him to remain. But while greatly appreciating
his employer’s kindness, young Kelly replied that his
mother and her large family mainly looked to him,
the elder brother, for support, and that it had always
been his intention to go into business on his own
account. The time had now come to carry out that
purpose. Mr. Bennett, in his brusque but kindly
Scotch voice, gave John some parting advice and
wished him well, predicting that success awaited him
in his future career. The boy now apprenticed himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
to Jacob B. Creamer, a grate-setter and soap-stone
cutter at 346 Broome Street, then on the corner of
Broome and Elizabeth, and speedily learned that trade.
He had grown to be a large boy, with the thews and
sinews of a young Hercules, and although he was not
quarrelsome, he was high spirited and courageous, and
would brook no insult from anyone. In the factory
where he worked there was another young man, three
or four years older than himself, a dark complexioned
powerful fellow, of a domineering temper, with a
reputation for fisticuffs. One day this person got
angry with Kelly and struck him. Kelly returned
the blow. The men in the establishment separated
them, but the blood of both was up, and a fight was
agreed upon between them as soon as the bell should
be rung for dinner. They went into the factory
yard and prepared for battle. The hands about
the establishment finding the boys meant to fight,
undertook to secure fair play in the encounter. Kelly
was much shorter than his antagonist, and no one
supposed he had any chance to win. At it they went
pell mell, with a lively interchange of heavy thuds.
The older youth fought rapidly, and brought Kelly
down several times with furious blows. Fighting
was not allowed while either of the boys was on the
ground, and in this way matters progressed for fifteen
or twenty minutes, Kelly getting the worst of it all
the time, but showing great endurance, and urging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
that no one should interfere. He had made thus far
but very little impression on his antagonist. He
observed, however, that one of his chance blows had
caused the other to wince with pain. From that
moment he took all the punishment the larger boy
could inflict, and made the battle one of strategy,
reserving himself to give a blow in the same place,
which he found to be the other’s weak spot. The
tide now began to turn, and it soon became evident
to the onlookers that the big swarthy fellow was no
match either in courage or endurance for Kelly. The
latter, selecting the weak spot, laid his antagonist on
his back several times by well-directed blows. The
last time he fell both his strength and courage collapsed,
and he bellowed out crying that he was
whipped and would fight no more. One of the men
who had witnessed the encounter with the closest
attention from beginning to end, and saw that Kelly
had won it by superior intelligence, now rushed up to
him, and taking his hand exclaimed, “Well Johnny,
my boy, you are a born general sure, and you will yet
be a great general over men when you grow up to be
a man yourself.” A few years ago an aged man
entered Mr. Kelly’s crowded office at 117 Nassau
street, and sent in his name with the rest. When
his turn came he was admitted. “Do you not know
me, Mr. Kelly?” said the old man. “No,” was the
reply, “I do not recall you.” “Do you remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
when you were a boy the fight you had with that big
swarthy fellow in Creamer’s factory yard, when
one of the men told you you would one day become
a great general over men? Well, I was that very
man, and didn’t I tell the truth, sir?” Mr. Kelly
remembered the occurrence and his visitor too, immediately,
whom he had not seen for many years,
and laughed heartily over the reminiscence of his
youth as he shook the old man’s hand.</p>

<p>He worked industriously at his new occupation, and
is said to have displayed mechanical skill of no mean
order. In due time he set up in business for himself,
made friends rapidly, and secured an excellent line of
custom. He became a prosperous young man, and
was remarked upon for sobriety, modesty of deportment
and attention to business. It was not long
before he found himself able to branch out on a more
extensive scale, for his friends were numerous and
willing to lend him a helping hand when the needs of
his business made it expedient to ask credit. While
yet a very young man, his success was sufficiently
assured to justify him in establishing a soap-stone and
grate factory at 40 Elizabeth street, and he also opened
an office where he took business orders, in a frame
building on Broome street, next door to the church
over which Dr. Maclay at that time presided, and of
which Dr. Cohen, in subsequent years, became the
pastor. Among his customers were Thomas O’Conor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
father of Charles O’Conor, the lawyer; John A.
Dix, afterward Governor of New York; Horace F.
Clark, and many other influential people. John
Kelly had now become a prosperous man. His first
care was for the beloved mother who had shaped the
days of his youth in the ways he should walk, but
who departed this life in the most edifying sentiments
of piety when he was quite a young man, scarcely
twenty-one years of age. His next care was for his
younger brother and five sisters, towards whom he
acted as a father, and for whose education and welfare
he was now able to provide in a suitable manner. His
own early struggles for education had taught him to
appreciate it highly in others, and he secured to his
brother and sisters advantages which disciplined their
youthful years and qualified them for the duties of
after life. Later on he took his brother into partnership
with him, but that brother and all his sisters,
save one, Mrs. Thomas, who lives near Mexico, in
Oswego County, New York, died many years ago.
Mr. Kelly, as already mentioned, owed to his mother’s
care the blessing of right training in his youth, and the
consequent formation of his character in the practice
of the Christian virtues. An old New Yorker who
knew his mother, has told the writer she was a
thorough disciplinarian, and taught her children to
love the truth in all things, and that the beginning of
wisdom is the fear of the Lord. His mother died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
before her son’s brilliant success began; she who
had equipped him for the battle stayed not to enjoy
its triumphs.</p>

<p>At this period of his life John Kelly had not a
dream of ever entering upon a political career. In
this respect he resembled another distinguished New
York statesman, the late Daniel S. Dickinson, who
began life as a mechanic, became a woollen manufacturer,
and, beyond being an earnest Democrat, passed
several years with no inclination whatever for the field
of politics. It was true, however, that even from his
boyhood John Kelly displayed rare capacity to lead
others, and he now found himself, in spite of preoccupation
in the manufacturing business, constantly
called on by neighbors seeking his advice and instinctively
following him. He was once asked by a newspaper
reporter if he ever sowed wild oats in his youth.
“That may be called a leading question,” he replied;
“I was in a gambling-house once in my life, but it was
on business—not to gamble. And I never was in a
house of assignation in my life. I don’t know what
the inside of such a house is.” “It is charged against
you,” the reporter said, “that you attend church very
regularly, and that you do it for effect.” “Well,”
Mr. Kelly said, “that’s a queer charge to make against
any one. I had a good careful mother who sent me
to the Sunday-school regularly. I have been to church
regularly ever since. Under such training, no doubt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
I ought to be a great deal better Christian than I am.
I suppose I have been very wicked sometimes, and
yet I can’t recall any time when I have been wilfully
bad.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>“During Tweed’s ascendancy in New York politics,”
said the well informed Utica editor, in the
article already quoted from, “Mr. Kelly retired from
Tammany Hall. Between him and Tweed the bitterest
hostility always existed. It is pleasant to believe
that Kelly’s superior virtue made him distasteful to
the burly champion of corruption. But that does not
account for their feud. During the glow of his guilty
glory, Tweed’s ambition was to secure the endorsement
of men of unimpeachable character. By turning
back a page in political history, we might show how
well he succeeded. But he could not make terms
with John Kelly, for Mr. Kelly would accept no position
but that of ruler. William M. Tweed swore a
solemn oath that John Kelly never should control
Tammany Hall—and we all know what came of it.”</p>

<p>Shortly before his death, while he was a prisoner in
Ludlow Street Jail, Tweed was interviewed by a New
York <cite>Herald</cite> reporter, and gave with undeserved freedom
his impressions of the leading men he had known
in politics. “Whom,” said the reporter, “do you
regard as the most successful city politician of New
York in the thirty years of your experience?” “John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
Kelly,” said Tweed. “He was always a plodder—always
saving something and learning something.
He stood well with the Church—rather a high class
man in the Church—and got his support there. I
never did but one thing for him; twenty years ago
I helped him beat Walsh for Congress.” “When you
came to politics,” asked the reporter, “did you ever
remotely entertain the idea of such proportions as the
Ring afterwards assumed?” “No,” said Tweed.
“The fact is, New York politics were always dishonest—long
before my time. There never was a
time when you couldn’t buy the Board of Aldermen,
except now. If it wasn’t for John Kelly’s severity,
you could buy them now.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The reporter of the <cite>World</cite>, with an odd sort of
unconscious humor in his interview, not unlike
Tweed’s commercial valuation of piety as an investment,
so naively suggested by the words, “rather a
high class man in the Church,” bluntly told Mr. Kelly
that it was not only complained against him that he
attended Church, but that he aggravated the matter
by attending it very regularly. No wonder Kelly
should have thought that a “queer charge” to make
against him.</p>

<p>An old citizen of New York, acquainted with him
from his youth, is authority for the statement that
Kelly was as fully a leader of the young men of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
neighborhood when he first grew up, as he became of
the Tammany Democrats at a later day. He was of a
social disposition, and while always temperate in his
habits, he would go occasionally, after getting through
with his day’s work, to the Ivy Green, a famous
hostelry in those days in Elm street, kept by Malachi
Fallon, who went to California in 1849, and which
was afterward kept by John Lord. The Ivy Green,
like Stonehall’s in Fulton Street, was a popular
gathering place for politicians and their friends.
John Clancy, Peter B. Sweeny, Matthew Brennan,
David C. Broderick, and many other active young
fellows, who afterwards became prominent in politics,
were in the habit of visiting the Ivy Green, and John
Kelly would sometimes call there for a chat with the
boys. Less frequently, but once in a great while,
Kelly and Broderick, the latter being a warm friend
of Kelly’s, also dropped in at the Comet, another
place of resort of the same kind, kept by Manus
Kelly on Mott street, where they would meet the
same jolly crowd that frequented the Ivy Green, and
whither came quite often the celebrated Tom Hyer,
Yankee Sullivan, and other champions of the manly
art of self-defence. “But,” said the writer’s informant,
“none of these fighting men ever intermeddled
with Kelly or Broderick. The best of them would
have had his hands full if he had done so.” Poor
Broderick, who afterwards became a United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
Senator from California, finally fell in a duel in that
State.</p>

<p>Young Kelly was very fond of athletic sports. He
was a good oarsman, was often on the water, and
pulled a shell with the best. There was a crack company
called the Emmet Guards in New York, when
Kelly was a young man. He was first lieutenant of
this company during the captaincy of James McGrath,
upon whose death he was elected captain, and being
fond of military matters, he brought his company to a
high state of efficiency. Captain Kelly retained the
command until he was elected Alderman in 1853.
The Old Volunteer Fire Department was then in its
zenith. He was a member of it, and one of its leading
spirits. While he was in the Fire Department an
incident occurred which has exercised a restraining
influence over him through life. At a fireman’s parade,
while he was in line of March, a burly truckman
attempted to drive through the ranks. Kelly was
near the horses and kept them back. The driver
sprang to the ground, and made a furious attack on
the young fire laddie. He received in return a blow
from Kelly’s fist which ended the battle by rendering
the truckman insensible. He was borne to a neighboring
doctor’s office, and was resuscitated with much
difficulty. For two or three days the truckman was
disabled. Kelly, who had acted strictly on the defensive,
nevertheless was greatly distressed for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
antagonist. He had been unaware of the almost phenomenal
force of his own blow, and his tremendous
hitting power was first fully revealed to him by the
effect of his fist on the truckman. To one of his
intimate friends he declared that he deeply regretted
this affair, but that, perhaps, it had served a good purpose,
for he was now unalterably resolved never again
as long as he lived to strike any man with all his force,
no matter what the provocation might be.</p>

<p>His herculean strength and known courage have
sometimes been seized upon by opponents for disparaging
paragraphs in the newspapers, just as the combativeness
of Andrew Jackson, in his earlier days, was
often commented upon to his detriment. But as there
was nothing mean or domineering in the temper of
Jackson, any more than there is in Kelly, only the
high and unconquerable spirit that felt “the rapture
of the strife,” Old Hickory did not suffer in popular
esteem on account of his early scrimmages. In 1828
Dr. James L. Armstrong, one of his old opponents in
Tennessee, gathered up and published as a political
nosegay a list of nearly one hundred pistol, sword and
fist fights in which Jackson had been engaged between
the ages of 23 and 60. Jackson replied to this by
promising to cudgel Armstrong on sight. The courage
of some men is so conspicuous that they are
recognized at once as heroes. In his admirable life
of Nelson, Southey relates many acts of apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
reckless intrepidity on the part of the hero of Trafalgar;
but, as it was with Jackson, so was it with Nelson,
his conduct was not the result of real recklessness;
it was not the courage of the bull-dog, the maddened
bull or the enraged lion, but rather the play of a spirit
which rose with the occasion, the exhibition of a will
not to be appalled by dangers common natures shrink
from. It was such a courage the poet had in view
when he made Brutus say—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Set honor in one eye, and death i’ the other,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And I will look on both indifferently.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On several occasions in his career John Kelly has
exhibited this heroic quality. Through his agency, at
a stormy political convention in New York, when
several of the most notorious partisans of Tweed,
while clutching to retain the power which had been
wrested from their fallen chief, were beaten at every
point, a resort to brute force was threatened, and
several of the vilest desperadoes in the city were despatched
from the hall to waylay Kelly and take his
life as he passed along the street. Some of his friends
divined the purpose of the would-be-assassins, and admonished
Mr. Kelly of their movements. A carriage
was sent for, and he was urged to get into it and be
driven home, in order to avoid the bravos. Augustus
Schell, Horace F. Clark, and several other friends
tried to persuade him to enter the carriage. Mr.
Kelly replied that he generally went home by a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
route, pointing to the street where the thugs
were in hiding, and it was his intention to go that
way then. If anybody wanted to kill him, the opportunity
would be given, as he would neither seek nor
avoid such miscreants. “My friends,” he quietly remarked,
“if you run away from a dog, he will be
very apt to bite you.” He went out of the hall and
approached the corner, keeping his eyes steadily fixed
on the sinister group gathered there like beasts of
prey, passed on, and was not molested. Determined
to take his life, but deterred by cowardice when
Kelly confronted them, the villains made a plan to
secrete themselves in a small unoccupied frame house
on Lexington Avenue, between 33d and 34th streets,
on the following morning, and to shoot him as he
went down town to business. An old man living in
the neighborhood, by the merest accident overheard a
part of the muttered plot of the conspirators, and saw
them early next morning enter the deserted house.
He was a friend of Mr. Kelly, and suspected that he
was to be attacked. He went out, and meeting Mr.
Kelly, told him of his suspicion, and pointed out the
house in which the men were concealed. John Kelly
crossed the street, and proceeded deliberately to enter
the house and room from which the Ring desperadoes
in dumb astonishment watched his approach. Thinking
they had been betrayed—for it must have flashed
upon them that Kelly would not have the madness to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
do such a thing unless he had assistance at hand—the
terrified assassins fled from the rear of the house as he
entered at the front. He went into the room they
had just quit, and saw four men running through a
vacant lot as fast as their legs could carry them into
the next street. Alone and absolutely unassisted,
save by the cool judgment and unflinching courage
which eminently distinguish his character, he adopted
this hazardous line of conduct as the most effective
way of confounding a gang of murderous ruffians,
and stamping out their cowardly plots. He succeeded.
The Ring men beset his path no more.</p>

<p>Those acquainted with John Kelly are aware that
there is a humorous side to his character, and that he
possesses mimic powers of a high order. It is not
generally known, but it is a fact however, that when
he first grew up to manhood he was one of the organizers
of an Amateur Dramatic Association, which had
its headquarters in a hall at the corner of Elm and
Canal Streets, and which sent forth several professional
actors who afterwards attained eminence on the
stage. Charles Place, Samuel Truesdale, Mr. Godwin,
John Kelly and other well known citizens of New
York were members of this company; and several
great tragedies, notably some of the now neglected
ones of Shakespeare, were essayed by these aspiring
youths. “Many of Mr. Kelly’s friends,” said a writer
in September, 1880, in a New York weekly paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
called <cite>The Hour</cite>, “will be surprised to learn that he
once, in the character of Macbeth, sturdily challenged
Macduff to ‘lay on’; that as the sable-clad Hamlet
he was accustomed to win applause as he expressed
the wish that his ‘too, too solid flesh would melt’;
and that his passionate outbursts as the jealous Moor
in ‘Othello’, were wont to bring down the house.
Equally astonished will they be to hear that, in the
versatility of his genius, he was as much a favorite
in ‘Toodles’ and other of Burton’s eccentric comedy
parts as in the higher walk of tragedy.”</p>

<p>In Kelly’s younger days religious persecution and
hostility to foreigners had begun to be shown in not a
few localities. This intolerant spirit, which had lain
dormant in America from the days of Washington to
the end of Monroe’s administration, broke forth with
great fury in several parts of the country after the
close of the “era of good feeling.” The fathers of the
Republic were liberal men who kept this spirit at a
distance. Archbishop Carroll of Baltimore, the friend
of Washington, was chosen by a unanimous resolution
of Congress, and in compliance with the desire of
the clergy and laity of all denominations, to deliver
the first anniversary address upon the father of his
country after his death. The address was delivered
February 22, 1800, and is still preserved. Bishop
Cheverus of Boston, afterwards Cardinal Archbishop
of Bordeaux, France, was the warm personal friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
of John Adams, and when the Bishop was about to
build a church in Boston, the first name on the list of
his subscribers was that of President Adams. When
Bishop Dubois, the friend of Lafayette, was driven
into exile by the French Revolution, he found a place
of refuge in Virginia, a home in the private residence
of James Monroe, afterwards President, friends in
his host and Patrick Henry, and, having no church
of his own, a chapel in the capitol at Richmond which
the legislature of Virginia placed at his disposal to be
used for the offices of religion. These halcyon days
of Christian charity and toleration in America were
now about to be rudely interrupted. In 1831, the
same Dubois, then Bishop of New York, had the mortification
to see his church of St. Mary’s, in that city,
set on fire by an incendiary and burned down. The
first Catholic college in the State of New York was
built in the neighborhood of Nyack, on the Hudson,
in 1833, by this prelate. Religious bigotry incited by
Rev. Dr. Brownlee and other enemies of the Catholics,
soon applied the torch to the structure and reduced it
to ashes. In 1834 the Ursuline Convent at Charlestown,
Massachusetts, was burned and sacked. Two
or three years later an anti-Catholic mob formed the
design of burning St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New
York. A pious churchman, Bishop Dubois was also
a man of courage. If the civil authorities would not
stay the fury of the mob, he determined to protect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
himself, and defend his church from destruction.
John Kelly, then a well grown youth and a favorite
of Bishop Dubois, was selected by him on account of
his prudence and extraordinary courage as a sort of
<em>aid de-camp</em> to Lawrence Langdon, the leader of a
large body of citizens who assembled in the vicinity
of the Cathedral for defense. The streets were torn
up for a considerable distance; paving stones, wagons
and omnibuses were used for barricades; armed
men filled the Cathedral, and the walls of the adjoining
grave-yard glistened with swords and bayonets.
The Bishop enjoined the utmost forbearance upon his
people, and gave them positive orders not to begin the
assault, and to avoid collision with the mob until the
Cathedral might be attacked. Conspicuous in carrying
out the orders of the leader, and in directing the
movements of the defending party, and maintaining
constant communication between Langdon and his
followers, was young John Kelly of the Fourteenth
Ward. The mob approached through Broadway, a
dense body extending for several blocks, marching in
solid line and filling the street from one side to the
other. They turned into Prince Street and approached
the Cathedral. Kelly carried the order at
this moment for the defenders to lie down in the
grave-yard and keep perfectly quiet. It was night,
and the mob marched on until stopped by the barricades,
when they found the whole neighborhood in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
a state of siege. The ample preparations to receive
them disconcerted the church-burners, and the silence
of the defending party, of whose presence they had
become aware, made the incendiaries wary and apprehensive.
They faltered and lost heart, and slunk away
in the direction of the Bowery, terrified from their
wicked design by the intrepid courage of one old
Bishop. They passed along the sidewalk adjoining the
burial-ground in lines six deep, with frightful oaths
upon their lips, while the men in the city of the dead
remained as still and motionless as the tenants of the
tombs below, but every finger was on a trigger, and
every heart beat high with resolve to defend St.
Patrick’s Cathedral and the graves of their fathers
from sacrilege and desecration. Driven by cowardly
fear from the church, the mob crossed to the Bowery,
wrecking the houses of several Irishmen, and the
tavern called the Green Dragon, on the way, and
finally their fury was let loose on the private residence
of Mr. Arthur Tappan, the famous abolitionist,
whose windows and doors they broke, and otherwise
injured his property. Thus by the prudence of the
Cathedral defenders in avoiding collision with the
mob, a terrible sacrifice of life was escaped, and
young John Kelly, inspired by the counsel of the
Bishop and his own coolness and sagacity, played a
prominent part in preventing bloodshed and saving
the Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>The prejudice against foreigners, an outgrowth of
that aversion which the old Federal party leaders
manifested towards Frenchmen, Germans and Irishmen,
indeed to all foreigners except Englishmen,
continued to increase in bitterness after the close of
the “era of good feeling.” A political party was at
last organized on a platform of disfranchisement of the
Irish and “the Dutch,” the latter being a commonly
used misnomer for the Germans. This party took the
name of Native Americans. It advocated laws prohibiting
Irish and German emigrants from landing on
these shores, and practical denial of the right of suffrage,
or of holding office, to those already here. For
some years this unwise and unstatesmanlike policy of
exclusion and proscription seriously checked the tide
of emigration from Europe. Had the Native Americans
prevailed, instead of the fifty odd millions of
population in the United States to-day, there would
have been less than twenty millions, and the wealth
and greatness of the country would be diminished in
like proportion. Instead of being, perhaps, the greatest
nation in the world, the United States would
occupy the position of a fourth or fifth-rate power, a
little but not much ahead of Canada on the north, and
the South American governments on the south.</p>

<p>As the greater number of the foreign population
were Roman Catholics, a sectarian element was infused
into the new party, and with bigotry superadded to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
widespread jealousy of foreigners, the Native American
party soon signalized itself by burning down Catholic
churches and colleges, and by bloody chance-medleys
and deliberate riots with German and Irish adopted
citizens. In the year 1844 these disturbances reached
a climax. A terrible riot occurred that year in Philadelphia,
in which many lives were sacrificed, and the
Catholic church of St. Augustine was laid in ashes by
the mob. The scenes in that city bore resemblance
to some of the godless excesses in Paris during the
reign of terror. To be a foreigner was to brave death,
to be a Catholic to court martyrdom in free America.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture the Native American party
in the city of New York again threatened the destruction
of St. Patrick’s Cathedral. The New York
<cite>Courier and Enquirer</cite>, and <cite>Evening Express</cite> fanned
the passions of the people to white heat by appeals to
sectarian and race prejudices. But there was a man
then at the head of the Catholic Church in New York
who possessed many of the qualities for which Andrew
Jackson was distinguished. Bishop Hughes belonged
to the tribe of the lions. He perceived that it was the
favorite policy of the Native Americans to make New
York city an anti-foreign stronghold. There, Catholics
and adopted citizens were powerful; crushed there, it
would be an easy matter to prostrate them everywhere.
In the month of May, 1844, the Native
American leaders in New York, invited their brethren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
of Philadelphia, who had most distinguished themselves
in the deplorable events in that city, to visit
New York, and to bring with them emblems of the
horrible scenes in Kensington at the time of the burning
of the church of St. Augustine, the better to fire
the New York heart. A delegation of Philadelphians
promised to accept the invitation and carry on the
emblems. A public reception, and a procession through
the streets, were to take place. It became evident
that the purpose of this sinister movement was to
re-enact in New York the scenes which had just disgraced
Philadelphia. Bishop Hughes took decisive
action. He admonished Catholics to keep away from
public meetings and unusual gatherings of the populace,
and, to avoid in a special manner, all disturbers
of the peace. That great man, in looking over the
city for prudent and conservative persons to aid him
in carrying out his policy of forbearance, found no one
on whom he more implicitly relied, and who proved
more effective in the emergency than John Kelly.
Bishop Hughes and John Kelly’s father were natives
of the same county and neighborhood in Ireland.
Between the Bishop and his fellow countryman’s son
a warm friendship existed. They were both endowed
with minds of singular originality and power, both
natural leaders of men, both possessed a remarkable
hold on the respect and affections of the people.
Among the Whigs, at this perilous juncture, Bishop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Hughes also found several powerful supporters, chief
among whom were William H. Seward, Horace Greeley
and Thurlow Weed. As the time drew near for the
Native American demonstration, popular excitement
and fears of a terrible riot increased. Bishop Hughes
now called on the Mayor of the city, Robert H. Morris,
and advised him not to allow the demonstration to
take place. “Are you afraid that some of your
churches may be burned?” the Mayor asked. “No,
sir, but I am afraid that some of yours will be
burned,” the Bishop said; “we can protect our own.
I came to warn you for your own good.” “Do you
think, Bishop, that your people would attack the procession?”
“I do not; but the Native Americans
want to provoke a Catholic riot, and if they can do it
in no other way, I believe they would not scruple to
attack the procession themselves, for the sake of making
it appear that the Catholics had assailed them.”</p>

<p>“What, then, would you have me do?” asked the
Mayor. “I did not come to tell you what to do,” the
Bishop said. “I am a Churchman, not the Mayor
of New York; but if I were the Mayor, I would
examine the laws of the State and see if there were
not attached to the police force a battery of artillery,
and a company or so of infantry, and a squadron of
horse; and I think I should find that there were; and
if so, I should call them out. Moreover, I should
send to Mr. Harper, the Mayor-elect, who has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
chosen by the votes of this party. I should remind
him that these men are his supporters; I should warn
him that if they carry out their designs there will be
a riot; and I should urge him to use his influence in
preventing the public reception of the delegates.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>This characteristic stand of Bishop Hughes had its
effect. No public reception of the church burners
took place, but for nearly two weeks the Cathedral
was guarded every night, and the mob which threatened
its destruction was kept at bay. During those
dark days Bishop Hughes found John Kelly to be
one of the most prudent young men in the Cathedral
parish, energetic in danger, conservative in conduct,
and always responsive to the call of duty. His manly
bearing then may be said to have laid the foundation
of that enduring confidence in his judgment, and
respect for his character, which the Bishop ever afterwards
felt and expressed. Mr. Kelly was not a zealot,
and there is not a tinge of bigotry in his nature. He
was then, as he is now, a true liberal, and has always
declared that religion and politics should be kept as
wide apart as the poles. But he is the foe of intolerance,
and while despising the arts of the demagogue,
no man in New York has done more to uphold foreign
citizens in their rights, and to emancipate the ballot-box
from persecution on the one hand, and fraudulent
voting on the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>The Native American party finally developed into
the notorious Know-Nothing movement, the party of
grips, and signs, and dark-lanterns. In many of the
election districts of New York no foreigner dared
approach the polls. The primaries were even worse,
and were conducted in defiant disregard of the election
laws. In John Kelly’s ward, which was a fair
illustration of every other ward in the city, any Irishman
or German risked his life by going to the polls.
Gangs of repeaters and thugs, as far as they could,
kept all foreigners from the primaries. These tools
of the Know-Nothing leaders would fill the room
where the election was held, take possession of the
line, crowd out their opponents by threats or violence,
return again and again, force their way, after passing
the spot where the votes were received, once
more into the line, and repeat the farcical act of
voting a second and third time, keeping up the villany
until relieved by another squad of repeaters, who continued
to enact the same scenes until the close of the
polls. A friendly police force connived at these rascalities,
and openly backed up the repeaters and ballot-box
stuffers whenever a determined citizen, in the
exercise of his rights, resisted expulsion from the line,
or attempted to defend himself from assault. So
great became the terror these law-breakers inspired,
that opposition to them was practically at an end.
This state of affairs was more humiliating, since the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
majority of voters in the Fourteenth Ward were
known to be Democrats. John Kelly protested against
these outrages as a private citizen, and at a meeting
of Democrats declared his intention of attending the
next primary election in the Fourteenth Ward, then
near at hand, and exercising his right of voting at all
hazards. Those who knew the man knew this was
not an idle boast, but many tried to dissuade him
from the rash attempt, which, if persisted in, would
likely enough cost him his life.</p>

<p>The primary election was to take place in a hall,
long since removed, in the march of the city, which then
stood on the corner of Grand and Elizabeth Streets.
The part of the room for the inspectors’ seats was
protected by a high partition, and a box desk, like a
bank teller’s window, with a hole only large enough
for a voter’s hand to be put through in handing his
ballot, to the receiving inspector, was placed at one
side of the partition. A narrow path in the main
room, fenced in by high rails, to allow but one voter
to approach at a time, afforded the only means of
access to the polls. When the voter handed in his
ballot, that was the last he saw of it, as the partition
effectually shut off observation from without. As a
matter of fact it was the practice of the inspector to
throw the vote into a waste basket, on the floor at his
feet, if it was not of the approved sort. This mode of
taking the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</i> had long been in practice, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
was not only an open evasion of the statute, which
provided for the presence of watchers for the several
parties, whose legal right it was to see that all had a
fair opportunity to vote, but it was adopted with the
deliberate purpose of protecting the swindling inspectors
from detection while engaged in the nefarious
work of making way with legal ballots. On the day
of the election John Kelly was early on the scene, and
was accompanied by a large number of the lawful
voters of the ward, who appointed him as their
watcher at the polls. He and his friends forced their
way into the hall, and as the black hole, behind which
the frauds were practiced, was there in violation of the
statute, it was straightway demolished, in order to
secure at least a semblance of fairness to the voting
about to take place. The Know-Nothings were at first
struck dumb with astonishment at this bold step on the
part of the Democrats. To defend themselves from
violence was as much as the latter had previously attempted.
Rage soon took the place of surprise, and a
furious attack was made on those who had removed
the box screen from about the inspectors’ desk. John
Kelly, who had been recognized as a Democratic
watcher, was also set upon by the gang of ballot-box
stuffers. A fierce scuffle ensued. But the Democrats
outnumbered the Know-Nothings, and drove them
from the hall. The leaders of the latter party, uttering
vows of vengeance, declared they would soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
return with reinforcements, and make short work of
Kelly and his party. They repaired to the ship-carpenters’
quarters at the foot of Delaney street, and
soon the news of their discomfiture was spread abroad
among the thousands of mechanics in that part of the
city. These mechanics were, for the most part, engaged
in ship building, for those were the days when New
York’s famous clipper ships whitened the seas and
brought back cargoes of commerce from all parts of the
world. The ship carpenters constituted a formidable
body of athletic men, whose influence at elections was
cast on the side of the Know-Nothings. It was not
long before a body of these mechanics, over a thousand
in number, was drummed up in Delaney street and
vicinity, and marshalled by notorious Know-Nothing
bullies, the crowd started for the hall in Grand street
to inflict condign punishment upon John Kelly and the
Fourteenth Ward Democrats, who had shown the unprecedented
audacity of interfering with the usual
Know-Nothing methods of carrying elections in that
ward. In the meantime the Democrats had not been
idle, but had recruited their own ranks to prepare for
the threatened attack. Soon the two parties came into
collision, and a desperate encounter took place. But
for a second time the victory remained with the Democrats.
The Know-Nothings, unaccustomed to serious
opposition, were not prepared for it now, and advanced
in a promiscuous manner, expecting to bear down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
opposition and to have everything their own way.
The Democrats presented a compact front, and fought
in companies of ten each. The hall was cleared a
second time of the assailing party. A great multitude
was now gathered in the streets threatening to
tear down or burn the building, when the Democrats
suddenly sallied forth with the precision of veterans,
and struck the Know-Nothing mob at a dozen different
points simultaneously. The mob being gathered
from all parts of the city greatly exceeded the Democrats
in numbers, but the sub-divisions of tens on the
part of the latter worked so well that their onslaught
became irresistible. Soon the mob were flying in all
directions, some seeking refuge in stores, others in
private houses, and the rest were pursued into and
through the Bowery with great impetuosity. “The
hour was come and the man.” None knew it better
than the Know-Nothing Dirk Hatteraicks of New
York. The effect of that day’s work in the Fourteenth
Ward was felt all over the city of New York
for years afterwards, and its immediate consequence
was to break the backbone of Know-Nothingism in
the ward in which it occurred. Thereafter Democrats,
whether native or foreign born, were not afraid
to appear at election places. The moral effect was
salutary. The timid were reassured, the indifferent
were roused into interest in public affairs, and fair
elections became more frequent in New York city.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
The one strong man who had worked this revolution
was John Kelly. The Irish and German population
looked upon him as their deliverer, and from that day
forth the Know-Nothing power on the East side of
the city dwindled into insignificance, and no further
attempts to stifle the voice of the majority took place.
Kelly became identified in the minds of the adopted
citizens of all nationalities, but especially of the Irish,
who were chiefly aimed at, as their champion. Henceforth
it was not possible for this strong man, this born
leader of his fellows, to follow the bent of his inclinations
and remain in a private station. He was elected
to the Board of Aldermen, and next to the Congress
of the United States. The Know-Nothings, by their
excesses in New York, had raised up an adversary
to their oath-bound secret organization who was destined
to accomplish as much in the Empire State for
equal rights to all citizens, native and foreign-born, as
Alexander H. Stephens, in a similar contest, wrought
out in Georgia, and Henry A. Wise, by his great anti-Know-Nothing
campaign accomplished in Virginia.</p>

<p>The future historian of the United States, when he
comes to treat of that extraordinary movement in
American politics called Know-Nothingism, will not
do justice to the subject unless he assigns the post of
honor in the work of its overthrow as a national organization
to Stephens of Georgia, Wise of Virginia,
and Kelly of New York. A glance at the great work
accomplished by these three men is all that can be
attempted in this memoir.</p>

<p>“True Americanism,” said Alexander H. Stephens
in his memorable Anti-Know-Nothing contest in
Georgia in 1855, “as I have learned it, is like true
Christianity—disciples in neither are confined to any
nation, clime or soil whatever. Americanism is not
the product of the soil; it springs not from the land
or the ground; it is not of the earth, or earthy; it
emanates from the head and the heart; it looks upward,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and onward and outward; its life and soul are
those grand ideas of government which characterize
our institutions, and distinguish us from all other
people; and there are no two features in our system
which so signally distinguish us from all other nations
as <em>free toleration</em> of religion and the doctrine of <em>expatriation</em>—the
right of a man to throw off his allegiance
to any and every other State, prince or
potentate whatsoever, and by <em>naturalization</em> to be
incorporated as a citizen into our body politic. Both
these principles are specially provided for and firmly
established in our Constitution. But these American
ideas which were proclaimed in 1789 by our ‘sires of
’76’ are by their ‘sons’ at this day derided and
scoffed at. We are now told that ‘naturalization’ is a
‘humbug,’ and that it is an impossibility. So did not
our fathers think. This ‘humbug’ and ‘impossibility’
they planted in the Constitution; and a vindication
of the same principle was one of the causes of
our second war of independence. Let no man, then,
barely because he was born in America, presume to
be imbued with real and true ‘Americanism,’ who
either ignores the direct and positive obligations of
the Constitution, or ignores this, one of its most
striking characteristics. An Irishman, a Frenchman,
a German, or Russian, can be as thoroughly American
as if he had been born within the walls of the
old Independence Hall itself. Which was the ‘true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
American,’ Arnold or Hamilton? The one was a
native, the other an adopted son.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Stephens had declined to be a candidate for
Congress in 1855, and the Know-Nothings taunted
him with cowardice, because, they said, if he should
run he knew he was doomed to defeat. His letter on
Know-Nothingism to Judge Thomas, from which the
preceding extract is quoted, was denounced furiously
by the Know-Nothings, who loudly predicted that
the letter would prove to be his political winding-sheet.
These taunts were published throughout the country,
and induced Mr. Stephens to change his mind, and
re-enter the field as a candidate for the Thirty-fourth
Congress. In a speech at Augusta, Georgia, in which
he announced this purpose, he said: “I have heard
that it has been said that I declined being a candidate,
because a majority of the district were Know-Nothings,
and I was afraid of being beaten. Now, to all men
who entertain any such opinion of me, I wish to say
that I was influenced by no such motive. I am afraid
of nothing on earth, or above the earth, or under the
earth, except to do wrong—the path of duty I shall
ever endeavor to travel, ‘fearing no evil,’ and dreading
no consequences. Let time-servers, and those
whose whole object is to see and find out which way
the popular current for the day and hour runs, that
they may float upon it, fear or dread defeat if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
please. I would rather be defeated in a good cause
than to triumph in a bad one. I would not give a fig
for a man who would shrink from the discharge of
duty for fear of defeat. All is not gold that glitters,
and there is no telling the pure from the base until it
is submitted to the fiery ordeal of the crucible and the
furnace. The best test of a man’s integrity and the
soundness of his principles is the furnace of popular
opinion, and the hotter the furnace the better the test.
I have traveled from a distant part of the State, where
I first heard these floating taunts of fear—as coming
from this district—for the sole and express purpose of
announcing to you, one and all, and in this most public
way to announce to the other counties, without
distinction of party, that I am again a candidate for
Congress in this district. The announcement I now
make. My name is hereby presented to the district;
not by any convention under a majority or a two-third
rule—but by myself.</p>

<p>“I know, fellow-citizens, that many of you differ
with me upon those exciting questions which are now
dividing—and most unhappily, too, as I conceive—dividing
our people. It is easy to join the shouts of
the multitude, but it is hard to say to a multitude
that they are wrong. I would be willing to go into
one of your Know-Nothing lodges or councils, where
every man would be against me, if I could be admitted
without first having to put myself under obligations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
never to tell what occurred therein, and there speak
the same sentiments that I shall utter here this night.
Bear with me, then, while I proceed.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is to
exhibit and hold up even to yourselves the great
evils and dangers to be apprehended from this ‘new,’
and, I think, most vicious political ‘monster,’ that
I would address you; and against the influences of
which I would warn and guard you, as well as the
rest of our people. While the specious outside title
of the party is that ‘Americans shall rule America,’
when we come to look at its secret objects as they
leak out, we find that one of its main purposes
is, not that ‘Americans shall rule America,’ but that
those of a particular religious faith, though as good
Americans as any others, shall be ruled by the rest.</p>

<p>“But it is said the ‘proscription’ is not against a
religious but a political enemy, and the Roman Church
is a political party, dangerous and powerful. Was a
bolder assertion, without one fact to rest upon, ever
attempted to be palmed off upon a confiding people?
The Roman Church a political party! Where are its
candidates? How many do they number in our State
Legislatures or in Congress? What dangers are they
threatening, or what have they ever plotted? Let
them be named. Was it when Lord Baltimore, a
Catholic, established the colony of Maryland, and for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the first time on this continent established the principle
of free toleration in religious worship? Was it
when Charles Carroll, a Catholic, signed the Declaration
of Independence? But it is said that great
danger is to be apprehended from the Catholics because
of a ‘secret order’ amongst them, known as
Jesuits. ‘No one,’ says a Know-Nothing writer,
‘knows, or possibly can know, the extent of their
influence in this country. One of them may eat at
your table, instruct your children, and profess to be
a good Protestant, and you never suspect him. Their
great aim is to make their mark in America. Perjury
to them is no sin, if the object of it be to spread
Catholicism or acquire political influence in the country.’
Whether this be true of the Jesuits or not I
cannot say. But I submit it to the consideration of
candid minds how far it is true of the new order
of Know-Nothings, which is now so strenuously
endeavoring to make its mark in America, and to
gain political influence in the country, not only by
putting down all foreigners, and all native-born citizens
who may be of Catholic faith, but also all
other native-born citizens who will not take upon
their necks the yoke of their power. Do not
hundreds and thousands of them go about daily
and hourly, denying that they belong to the order, or
that they know anything about it? May they not,
and do they not ‘eat at your table,’ attend your sick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
and some of them preach from your pulpits, and yet
deny that they know anything about that ‘order’
which they are making such efforts to spread in the
land? I do not say all of them do this; but is it not
common with the ‘order,’ thus by some sort of equivocation
and slippery construction, to mislead and
deceive those with whom they converse? There is
nothing worse that can be said of any man or any
people indicating a destruction of morals or personal
degradation, than that ‘the truth is not in him.’ It is
the life and soul of all the virtues, human or divine.
Tell me not that any party will effect reformation of
any sort, bad as we now are in this land, which brings
into disrepute this principle upon which rests all our
hopes on earth, and all our hopes for immortality.
And my opinion is that the Protestant ministers of
the Gospel in this country, instead of joining in this
New England, puritanical, proscriptive crusade against
Catholics, could not render a better service to their
churches, as well as the State, in the present condition
of morals amongst us, than to appoint a day for everyone
of them to preach to their respective congregations
from this text, ‘What is truth?’ Let it also be a day
set aside for fasting, humiliation and prayer—for repentance
in sackcloth and ashes—on account of the
alarming prevalence of the enormous sin of lying!
Was there ever such a state of general distrust between
man and man before? Could it ever have been said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of a Georgia gentleman, until within a few months
past, that he says so and so, but I don’t know whether
to believe him or not? Is it not bringing Protestantism,
and Christianity itself, into disgrace when such
remarks are daily made, and not without just cause,
about Church communicants of all our Protestant
denominations—and by one church member even
about his fellow-member? Where is this state of
things to lead to, or end, but in general deception,
hypocrisy, knavery, and universal treachery?</p>

<p>“Was ever such tyranny heard of in any old
party in this country as that which this new ‘order’
sets up? Every one of them knows, and whether they
deny it or not, there is a secret monitor within that
tells them that they have pledged themselves never to
vote for any Roman Catholic to any office of profit or
trust. They have thus pledged themselves to set up a
religious test in qualifications for office against the
express words of the Constitution of the United
States. Their very organization is not only anti-American,
anti-republican, but at war with the fundamental
law of the Union, and, therefore, revolutionary
in its character, thus silently and secretly to effect for
all practical purposes a change in our form of government.
And what is this but revolution? Not an
open and manly rebellion, but a secret and covert
attempt to undermine the very corner-stone of the
temple of our liberties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Whenever any government denies to any class of
its citizens an equal participation in the privileges,
immunities, and honors enjoyed by all others, it parts
with all just claim to their allegiance. Allegiance is
due only so long as protection is extended; and protection
necessarily implies an equality of right to
stand or fall, according to merit, amongst all the
members of society, or the citizens of the commonwealth.
The best of men, after all, have enough of
the old leaven of human nature left about them to
fight when they feel aggrieved, outraged and trampled
upon; and strange to say, where men get to fighting
about religion they fight harder, and longer and more
exterminatingly than upon any other subject. The
history of the world teaches this. Already we see the
spirit abroad which is to enkindle the fires and set the
fagots a blazing—not by the Catholics, they are comparatively
few and weak; their only safety is in the
shield of the constitutional guarantee; minorities seldom
assail majorities; and persecutions always begin
with the larger numbers against the smaller. But this
spirit is evinced by one of the numerous replies to my
letter. The writer says: ‘We call upon the children
of the Puritans of the North, and the Huguenots of
the South, by the remembrance of the fires of Smithfield,
and the bloody St. Bartholomew, to lay down
for once all sectional difficulties,’ etc., and to join in
this great American movement of proscribing Catholics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
What is this but the tocsin of intestine strife?
Why call up the remembrance of the fires of Smithfield
but to whet the Protestant appetite for vengeance?
Why stir up the quiet ashes of bloody St.
Bartholomew, but for the hope, perhaps, of finding
therein a slumbering spark from which new fires may
be started? Why exhume the atrocities, cruelties, and
barbarities of ages gone by from the repose in which
they have been buried for hundreds of years, unless it
be to reproduce the seed, and spread amongst us the
same moral infection and loathsome contagion?—just
as it is said the plague is sometimes occasioned in London
by disentombing and exposing to the atmosphere
the latent virus of the fell disease still lingering in the
dusty bones of those who died of it centuries ago.
Fellow citizens, Fellow Protestants, Fellow Americans—all
who reverence the constitution of your
country—I entreat you, and I envoke you to give no
listening ear to such fanatical appeals.</p>

<p>“When the principles of the Constitution are disregarded,
when those ‘checks and restraints,’ put in it as
Mr. Madison has told us, for ‘a defence to the people
against their own temporary errors and delusions,’ are
broken down and swept away, when the whole country
shall have been brought under the influence of the
third degree of this Know-Nothing order, if that time
shall ever come, then, indeed may the days of this
Republic, too, be considered as numbered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“I wish to say something to you about this third
degree, the union degree, as it is called. For under
this specious title, name or guise, the arch-tempter
again approaches us, quite as subtly as under the other
of ‘Americans shall rule America.’ The obligation
taken in this degree is ‘to uphold, maintain and defend’
the Union, without one word being said about
the Constitution. Now, as much as we all, I trust,
are devoted to the Union, who would have it without
the Constitution? This is the life and soul of it—this
is its animating spirit. It is this that gives it
vitality, health, vigor, strength, growth, development
and power. Without it the Union could never have
been formed, and without it it cannot be maintained
or held together. Where the animating principle of
any living organism is extinguished, this is death, and
dissolution is inevitable. You might just as well
expect that the component parts of your bodies could
be held together by some senseless incantations after
the vital spark has departed, as that this Union can
be held together by any Know-Nothing oaths when
the Constitution is gone. Congress is to be done
away with, except in so far as its members may be
necessary, as the dumb instruments for registering
the edicts of an invisible but all-powerful oligarchy.
Our present Government is to be paralyzed by this
boa-constrictor, which is now entwining its coils around
it. It is to be supplanted and displaced by another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
self-constituted and secretly organized body to rise up
in its stead, a political ‘monster,’ more terrible to
contemplate than the seven-headed beast spoken of in
the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>“I have seen it stated in the newspapers by some
unknown writer, that my letter to Col. Thomas will
be my political winding-sheet. If you and the other
voters of the Eighth Congressional District so will it,
so let it be; there is but one other I should prefer—and
that is the Constitution of my country; let me be
first wrapped in this, and then covered over with that
letter, and the principles I have announced this night;
and thus shrouded I shall be content to be laid away,
when the time comes, in my last resting-place without
asking any other epitaph but the simple inscription
carved upon the headstone that marks the spot—‘Here
sleep the remains of one who dared to tell the
people they were wrong when he believed so, and who
never intentionally deceived a friend, or betrayed even
an enemy.’”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Thus spoke Alexander H. Stephens, Georgia’s
greatest statesman, of the pernicious tendencies of the
Know-Nothing party. On that speech he ran for
Congress and was elected by three thousand majority.
Know-Nothingism was thus slain in Georgia. Since
the death of Mr. Stephens some scribbler with a talent
for forgery has taken the quotation marks from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
paragraph about the Jesuits in the foregoing speech,
affixed Mr. Stephens’s name to it, and sent it on its
rounds through the press as the declared opinion of
the dead statesman concerning the followers of Loyola.
Mr. Stephens quoted the paragraph from a Know-Nothing
writer, not to approve the attack on the
Jesuits, but for the opposite purpose of showing it
applied to the Know-Nothings themselves. No man
in this country could use the weapon of retort with
more effect than Alexander H. Stephens, and his remarks
on the paragraph in question afford a favorable
instance of his power in that line. That this stupid
calumny on the great man who battled so nobly for
the equal rights of Catholics and Protestants, Jews
and Gentiles, foreign born and native Americans,
should have been palmed off on the public, is less surprising
than that it should have found its way into
certain Catholic newspapers, in the columns of at least
one of which the present writer read it shortly after
the death of Mr. Stephens.</p>

<p>The ever memorable conflict in Virginia of 1855,
between the Know-Nothings and Democrats, was led
on the part of the latter by the gallant Henry A.
Wise. That conflict was one of great national magnitude.
If the Know-Nothings, theretofore victorious,
had then succeeded, it is likely a civil war precipitated
by religious fanaticism would have followed, not to be
conducted between the States, as later unfortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
occurred, but between citizens of the same cities, and
towns and neighborhoods throughout the Union, with
a fury to make humanity shudder—in every sense of
the word a civil war. The Virginia election of that
year was, therefore, watched with intense interest by
the whole American people, and a feeling of feverish
excitement was everywhere visible. Henry A. Wise,
the uncompromising enemy of the Know-Nothings,
was named as the Democratic candidate for Governor
of Virginia. Never was such a canvass before. He
went everywhere, pouring out fiery eloquence in the
Western Mountains, in the Blue Ridge that milks the
clouds, upon the Potomac, lovely River of Swans, on
the Rappahannock, the Piankatank, Mob Jack Bay,
James River, Elizabeth River, down to the North
Carolina line; and wherever he went this second
Patrick Henry stirred the people’s hearts as they had
not been stirred before. One of the best stump
speeches ever heard in this country was made by Mr.
Wise at Alexandria. He had declared hostility to the
Know-Nothings in a letter to a citizen of Virginia,
written September 18, 1854.</p>

<p>In that letter he said: “I am a native Virginian;
my ancestors on both sides for two hundred years were
citizens of this country and this State—half English,
half Scotch. I am a Protestant by birth, by baptism,
by intellectual belief, and by education and by adoption.
I am an American, in every fibre and in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
feeling an American; yet in every character, in every
relation, in every sense, with all my head and all my
heart, and all my might, I protest against this secret
organization of native Americans and of Protestants
to proscribe Roman Catholic and naturalized citizens.
As early as 1787 we established a great land ordinance,
the most perfect system of eminent domain, of
proprietary titles, and of territorial settlements, which
the world had ever beheld to bless the homeless
children of men. It had the very house-warming of
hospitality in it. It wielded the logwood axe, and
cleared a continent of forests. It made an exodus in
the old world, and dotted the new with log-cabins,
around the hearths of which the tears of the aged and
the oppressed were wiped away, and cherub children
were born to liberty, and sang its songs, and have
grown up in its strength and might and majesty. It
brought together foreigners of every country and
clime—immigrants from Europe of every language
and religion, and its most wonderful effect has been to
assimilate all races. Irish and German, English and
French, Scotch and Spaniard, have met on the Western
prairies, in the Western woods, and have peopled villages
and towns and cities—queen cities, rivalling the
marts of Eastern commerce; and the Teutonic and
Celtic and Anglo-Saxon races have in a day mingled
into one undistinguishable mass—and that one is
American. The children of all are crossed in blood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
in the first generation, so that ethnology can’t tell of
what parentage they are—they all become brother
and sister Jonathans. As in the colonies, as in the
revolution, as in the last war, so have foreigners and
immigrants of every religion and tongue contributed
to build up the temple of American law and liberty
until its spire reaches to heaven, whilst its shadow
rests on earth. If there has been a turnpike road
to be beaten out of the rocky metal, or a canal to be
dug, foreigners and immigrants have been armed with
the mattock and the spade and if a battle on sea and
land had to be fought, foreigners and immigrants have
been armed with the musket and the blade.</p>

<p>“We can name the very hour of our birth as a people.
We need recur to no fable of a wolf to whelp
us into existence. As a nation we are but seventy-eight
years of age. Many persons are now living who
were alive before this nation was born. And the ancestors
of this people about two centuries only ago
were foreigners, every one of them coming to the
shores of this country to take it away from the
aborigines, and to take possession of it by authority
either directly or derivatively of Papal Power. His
Holiness the Pope was the great grantor of all the
new countries of North America. Foreigners in the
name of the Pope and Mother Church took possession
of North America, to have and to hold the
same to their heirs against the heathen forever. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
now already their descendants are for excluding foreigners,
and the Pope’s followers from an equal enjoyment
of this same possession. So strange is human
history. Christopher Columbus! Ferdinand and
Isabella! What would they have thought of this had
they foreseen it when they touched a continent and
called it theirs in the name of the Holy Trinity, by
authority of the keeper of the keys of Heaven, and
of the great grantor of the empire and domain of
earth? What would have become of our national
titles to northeastern and northwestern boundaries,
but for the plea of this authority, valid of old among
all Christian powers?”</p>

<p>Writing thus in September, 1854, Mr. Wise,
although he had been a Whig years before, was nominated
for Governor by the Democrats in December of
the same year. In his famous Alexandria speech, before
discussing Know-Nothingism, he told the people
some practical truths explanatory of the decadence of
the prosperity of Virginia, of the causes producing it,
and the remedies to be applied. “You have,” he said,
“the bowels of your Western mountains rich in iron,
in copper, in coal, in salt, in gypsum, and the very
earth is so rich in oil that it sets the rivers in flame.
You have the line of the Alleghany, that beautiful
Blue Ridge which stands placed there by the Almighty,
not to obstruct the way of the people to market, but
placed there in the very bounty of Providence to milk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the clouds, to make the sweet springs which are the
sources of your rivers. And at the head of every
stream is the waterfall murmuring the very music of
your power to put spindles in motion. And yet commerce
has long ago spread her sails and sailed away
from you; you have not as yet dug more than coal
enough to warm yourselves at your own hearths; you
have set no tilt-hammer of Vulcan to strike blows
worthy of gods in the iron foundries. You have not
yet spun more than coarse cotton enough, in the way
of manufacture, to clothe your own slaves. You have
had no commerce, no mining, no manufactures. You
have relied alone on the single power of agriculture;
and such agriculture! Your sedge patches outshine the
sun. Your inattention to your only source of wealth
has scarred the very bosom of mother earth. Instead
of having to feed cattle on a thousand hills, you have
had to chase the stump-tailed steer through the sedge
patches to procure a tough beef-steak. You are in the
habit of discussing Federal politics; and permit me to
say to you, very honestly and very openly, that next
to brandy, next to card playing, next to horse-racing,
the thing that has done more harm to Virginia than
any other in the course of her past history, has been
her insatiable appetite for Federal politics. She has
given all her great men to the Union. Her Washington,
her Jefferson, her Madison, her Marshall, her
galaxy of great men she has given to the Union.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
Richmond, instead of attending to Richmond’s business,
has been too much in the habit of attending to
the affairs of Washington city, when there are plenty
there, God knows, to attend to them themselves. * *
“Puritanism,” said Mr. Wise, has disappeared, and
we have in place of it Unitarianism, Universalism,
Fourierism, Millerism, Mormonism—all the odds and
ends of isms—until at last you have a grand fusion
of all those odds and ends of isms in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnium
gatherum</i> of isms called Know-Nothingism. Having
swept the North, the question was: How can this ism
be wedged in in the South? And the devil was at the
elbow of these preachers of ‘Christian politics’ to tell
them precisely how.” [At this point Mr. Wise was
interrupted by cat-calls, derisive cheers and other
manifestations of the Know-Nothing element of the
meeting.] “There were three elements in the South,”
continued the speaker, “and in Virginia particularly,
to which they might apply themselves. There is the
religious element, the 103,000 Presbyterians, the
300,000 Baptists, the 300,000 Methodists of Virginia.
Well, how were they to reach them? Why, just by
raising a hell of a fuss about the Pope!</p>

<p>“Cæsar’s kingdom is political, is a carnal kingdom.
And I tell you that if I stood alone in the State of
Virginia, and if priestcraft—if the priests of my own
Mother Church dared to lay their hands on the political
power of our people, or to use their churches to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
wield political influence, I would stand, in feeble imitation
it may be, but I would stand, even if I stood
alone, as Patrick Henry stood in the Revolution, between
the parsons and the people. These men, many
of whom are neither Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
Baptists, Methodists, Congregationalists, Lutherans, nor
what not—who are men of no religion, who have no
church, who do not say their prayers, who do not read
their Bible, who live God-defying lives every day of
their existence, are now seen with faces as long as
their dark-lanterns, with the whites of their eyes
turned up in holy fear lest the Bible should be shut
up by the Pope! You tell the people that Catholics
never gave aid to civil liberty; that they never yet
struck a blow for the freedom of mankind. Who
gave you alliance against the crown of England? Who
but that Catholic king, Louis XVI. He sent you
from the Court of Versailles Lafayette, the boy of
Washington’s camp, a foreigner who never was naturalized,
but who bled at the redoubt of Yorktown,
when Arnold, a native, like Absalom proved traitor.</p>

<p>“And, Sir, before George Washington was born,
before Lafayette wielded the sword, or Charles Carroll
the pen for his country, six hundred and forty years
ago, on the 16th of June, 1214, there was another scene
enacted on the face of the globe, when the general
charter of all charters of freedom was gained, when
one man, a man called Stephen Langton, swore the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Barons of England for the people against the power
of the King—swore the Barons on the high altar of
the Catholic Church at St. Edmundsbury, that they
would have Magna Charta or die for it. The charter
which secures to every one of you to-day trial by jury,
freedom of the press, freedom of the pen, the confronting
of witnesses with the accused, and the opening of
secret dungeons—that charter was obtained by Stephen
Langton against the King of England, and if you
Know-Nothings don’t know who Stephen Langton
was, you know nothing sure enough. He was a
Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. I come here not
to praise the Catholics, but I come here to acknowledge
historical truths, and to ask of Protestants—what
has heretofore been the pride and boast of Protestants—tolerance
of opinion in religious faith.</p>

<p>“All that I have to say to the Democracy is that
you want active, earnest organization. Remember
that if these Know-Nothings hold together they are
sworn compact committees of vigilance. Go to work
then. Organize actively everywhere. Appoint your
vigilance committees, but take especial care that no
Know-Nothings are secretly and unknown to you
upon them. Be prepared. I have gone through most
of Eastern Virginia, and in spite of their vaunting I
defy them to defeat me. There are Indians in the
bushes, but I’ll whack on the bayonet, and lunge at
every shrub in the State till I drive them out. I tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
them distinctly there shall be no compromise, no
parley. I will come to no terms. They shall either
crush me, or I will crush them in this State.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wise, though his health was impaired, conducted
his campaign with extraordinary energy, travelling
about 3000 miles, to every point in the State,
and speaking fifty times before the election. He was
triumphantly elected Governor of Virginia, receiving
upwards of ten thousand majority over his Know-Nothing
competitor. The impartial verdict of history
is that Henry A. Wise did more to kill the Know-Nothing
party than any other man in the United
States.</p>

<p>Many Know-Nothings were elected to Congress
from the Northern States, and a few from the Southern
States. In the Senate and House of Representatives
there were seventy-eight members of that party in
1855. Conspicuous among them all, on account of
his prejudices no less than his ability, was Henry
Winter Davis, a member of the Thirty-fourth and
Thirty-fifth Congresses from Baltimore.</p>

<p>The celebrated controversy upon the floor of Congress
between Davis and John Kelly on the Know-Nothing
question entitles the Know-Nothing leader
to some notice here.</p>

<p>Henry Winter Davis was born at Annapolis, Maryland,
August 16, 1817, and received his education at
Kenyon College, Ohio, where he was graduated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
1837. His father was an Episcopalian minister.
Young Davis was sent to the University of Virginia in
1839 by his aunt, a Miss Winter of Alexandria, Virginia,
and entered upon his preparatory legal studies
at that institution. He afterwards opened a law
office at Alexandria, where he struggled with poverty
for some years, making but little mark in that community,
save as an occasional contributor of political
essays to the Alexandria <cite>Gazette</cite>, but applying himself
closely to his studies, and becoming an able lawyer.
Reverdy Johnson recognized his talents and
advised him to remove to Baltimore, where he would
find a wider field for their display. Mr. Davis acted
on this advice, and made Baltimore his home. He
had married a Miss Cazenove of Alexandria, who
soon died, and subsequently he married a daughter of
John S. Morris, a wealthy and prominent citizen of
Baltimore. Mr. Morris opposed the marriage on account
of Davis’s peculiar political views.</p>

<p>Henry Winter Davis was a man of genius, with a
natural bent for an opposition leader. In person he
was handsome, in manners haughty and reserved, in
demeanor elegant; and he possessed the gift of a fine
oratory, both logical and persuasive. A morose temper
and a cynical and cold nature served to heighten
the picturesque effect of his character, and to make
him delight in fomenting discord and violence.
“The ignorant Dutch and infuriated Irish, let them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
beware lest they press the bosses of the buckler too
far,” is said to have been a form of expression he applied
to Germans and Irishmen in the course of one of
his invectives on the stump in Baltimore. He soon
became an acknowledged leader of the Know-Nothings,
and no man knew better how to fire the rage and
incite to acts of bloodshed the Plug Uglies of that
city. Had Davis lived during the era of the Alien
and Sedition Laws, his genius probably would have
placed him at the head of that conspiracy, and his
name would have become famous in history. He was
a contemner of the sanctions of authority. The
sacredness of institutions handed down from generation
to generation unimpaired by the ravages of time,
awakened no sense of reverence in the mind of this
iconoclast. Burke’s beautiful allusion to the bulwarks
of civil society which have been stamped with the
“mysterious virtue of wax and parchment,” must
have appeared to him only as a figure of rhetoric or a
ridiculous fetich. How contemptuously he regarded
the warning of Washington to his countrymen in the
Farewell Address against entangling alliances with the
nations of Europe is discovered in the following passage,
found at page 367, of a book written by Mr.
Davis, called “The War of Ormuzd and Ahriman in
the Nineteenth Century.”</p>

<p>“They who stand with their backs to the future
and their faces to the past, wise only after the event,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
and refusing to believe in dangers they have not felt,
clamorously invoke the name of Washington in their
protest against interference in the concerns of Europe.
With such it is useless to argue till they learn the
meaning of the language they repeat.”</p>

<p>With many similar sophistries he declared it would
be wise policy on the part of the United States to take
part in European controversies, and pretended to find
warrant in the Monroe doctrine for this radical reversal
of Washington’s maxim. But that Davis was
a demagogue in the offensive sense of the word is
evident from the fact that the very advice of General
Washington against foreign influence, which he scouted
at in his book, was soon after relied upon by the same
Davis as his chief argument in Congress for the
exclusion of foreigners from the rights and privileges
of citizenship. In the course of a Know-Nothing
speech, delivered in the House of Representatives,
January 6th, 1857, he said: “Foreign allies have decided
the government of the country. * * * *
Awake the national spirit to the danger and degradation
of having the balance of power held by foreigners.
Recall the warnings of Washington against foreign
influence, here in our midst, wielding part of our
sovereignty; and with these sound words of wisdom
let us recall the people from paths of strife and error
to guard their peace and power.” The insincerity of
Davis is further shown from his conduct in regard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the Republican party. He denounced that party in
the speech above quoted from, saying, among other
things, “the Republican party has nothing to do and
can do nothing. It has no future. Why cumbers it
the ground?” In the course of a few years he became
a Republican, and notwithstanding his former denunciation
of them, swallowing at a single breath the most
ultra tenets of that party. Consistent only in his
inconsistencies, he again prepared to bolt from the
Republican organization shortly before his death, and
was the author of the celebrated Wade-Davis Manifesto
in 1864, against the renomination of Abraham
Lincoln. Once having been invited by a literary
society of the University of Virginia to deliver the
annual address before that body, he took up some
eccentric line of political conduct before the commencement
day occurred, and compelled the society
in self-respect to revoke its invitation. He affected
the Byronic manner, and the contagion spread to
other members of Congress. Roscoe Conkling, after
he entered the House of Representatives, is said to
have become a great admirer of Henry Winter Davis,
and to have fallen into his peculiarities of style as a
public speaker. Mr. Conkling’s famous parliamentary
quarrel with Mr. Blaine soon after occurred.</p>

<p>Such was the man the Know-Nothings recognized
as their leader in the House of Representatives when
John Kelly entered that body. In the early part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
1857 Mr. Kelly replied to a sneering assault of Mr.
Davis on the Irish Brigade, and in the debate which
followed not only proved himself able to cope with
the Know-Nothing leader, but in a running debate
with Mr. Kennett of Missouri, Mr. Akers of the same
State, and Mr. Campbell of Ohio, who entered the
lists against him, Kelly established his reputation as
one of the best off-hand debaters in Congress.</p>

<p>A few extracts from the speeches on the occasion,
which are taken from the <cite>Congressional Globe</cite>, will
furnish an idea of the style of the speakers, and the
merits of the controversy. In referring to the Presidential
election of 1856, and the victory of the Democrats,
Mr. Davis said: “The Irish Brigade stood firm
and saved the Democrats from annihilation, and the
foreign recruits in Pennsylvania turned the fate of the
day. They have elected, by these foreigners, by a
minority of the American people, a President to represent
their divisions. The first levee of President
Buchanan will be a curious scene. He is a quiet,
simple, fair-spoken gentleman, versed in the by-paths
and indirect crooked ways whereby he met this crown,
and he will soon know how uneasy it sits upon his
head. Some future Walpole may detail the curious
greetings, the unexpected meetings, the cross purposes
and shocked prejudices of the gentlemen who cross
that threshold. Some honest Democrat from the South
will thank God for the Union preserved. A gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
of the disunionist school will congratulate the
President on the defeat of Mr. Fillmore. The Northern
gentlemen will whisper ‘Buchanan, Breckenridge
and Free Kansas’ in the presidential ear, and beg
without scandal the confirmation of their hopes. * *
But how to divide the spoils among this motley crew—ah!
there’s the rub. Sir, I envy not the nice and
delicate scales which must distribute the patronage
amid the jarring elements of that conglomerate, as
fierce against each other as clubs in cards are against
spades. * * The clamors of the foreign legion will
add to the interest of the scene. They may not be
disregarded, for but for them Pennsylvania was lost,
and with it the day. Yet what will satisfy these
indispensable allies, now conscious of their power?
That, Sir, is the exact condition of things which will
be found in the ante-chamber—exorbitant demands,
limited means, irreconcilable divisions, strife, disunion,
dissolution—whenever the President shall have taken
the solemn oath of office and darkened the doors of
the White House.</p>

<p>“The recent election has developed in an aggravated
form every evil against which the American party
protested. Foreign allies have decided the government
of the country—men naturalized in thousands
on the eve of the election. Again in the fierce struggle
for supremacy, men have forgotten the ban which
the Republic puts on the intrusion of religious influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
on the political arena. These influences have
brought vast multitudes of foreign born citizens to the
polls, ignorant of American interests, without American
feelings, influenced by foreign sympathies, to vote
on American affairs; and those votes have, in point
of fact, accomplished the present result.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly replied to the Know-Nothing leader. He
said: “I rise for the purpose of submitting as briefly
as I can a few remarks in reply to the very extraordinary
speech of the honorable member from Baltimore
city. In the great abundance of his zeal to assail the
President of the United States, the gentlemen from
Baltimore could not permit so good an occasion to
pass without hurling his pointless invectives against
my constituents, in terms and temper which demand
a reply. * * * His ambition seems restless and
insatiable, for he cannot conclude his speech without
trying a bout with what he denominates the ‘Irish
Brigade.’ What particular class of our fellow-citizens
this fling was aimed at, I am at a loss to conjecture.
There is a body known to history under that appellation—a
body of historical reputation, whose deeds of
bravery on every battle-field of Europe have long
formed the glowing theme for the poet’s genius and
the sculptor’s art. But, sir, they were too pure to be
reached by the gentleman’s sarcasm—too patriotic to
be measured by his well conned calculation of the
‘loaves and fishes’ which have unfortunately slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
through his fingers—too brave to be terrified by the
menaces or insults of those who would justify brutal
murder—the murder of defenceless women and helpless
children—the sacking of dwellings and the burning
of churches, under the insolent plea of ‘summary
punishment.’ Sir, the Irish Brigade of history was
composed of patriots whom oppression in the land of
their birth had driven to foreign countries, to carve
out a home and a name by their valor and their
swords. The brightest page of the history of France
is that which records the deeds and the names of the
‘Irish Brigade.’ France, however, was not the only
country in which the Irish Brigade signalized its devotion
to liberty, and its bravery in achieving it. Sir,
the father of your own navy was one of that glorious
band of heroes who shed lustre on the land of their
birth, while they poured out their life-blood for the
country of their adoption. John Barry was a member
of the Irish Brigade in America—he, who when
tempted by Lord Howe with gold to his heart’s content,
and the command of a line-of-battle-ship, spurned
the offer with these noble words: ‘I have devoted myself
to the cause of my adopted country, and not the
value or command of the whole British fleet could
seduce me from it.’ He, who when hailed by the
British frigates in the West Indies and asked the
usual questions as to the ship and captain, answered:
‘The United States ship Alliance, saucy Jack Barry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
half-Irishman, half-Yankee. Who are you?’ Sir,
saucy Jack Barry, as he styled himself, was the first
American officer that ever hoisted the Stars and Stripes
of our country on board a vessel of war. So soon as
the flag of the Union was agreed on, it floated from
the mast-head of the Lexington, Captain John Barry.
But Captain John Barry was not the only member of
the ‘Irish Brigade’ whose name comes down to us
with the story of the privations and bravery of our
revolutionary struggle. Colonel John Fitzgerald was
also a member of that immortal band. Of this member
of the ‘Irish Brigade’ I will let the still living
member of Washington’s own household, the eloquent
and venerable Custis speak:</p>

<p>“‘Col. Fitzgerald,’ says G. W. P. Custis in his memoirs
of Revolutionary Heroes, ‘was an Irish officer
in the Blue and Buffs, the first volunteer company
raised in the South, in the dawn of the Revolution,
and commanded by Washington. In the campaign of
1778 and retreat through the Jerseys, Fitzgerald was
appointed aid-de-camp to Washington. At the battle
of Princeton occurred that touching scene, consecrated
by history to everlasting remembrance. The
American troops, worn down by hardships, exhausting
marches and want of food, on the fall of their leader,
that brave old Scotchman, General Mercer, recoiled
before the bayonets of the veteran foe. Washington
spurred his horse into the interval between the hostile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
lines, reigning up with the charger’s head to the foe,
and calling to his soldiers, ‘Will you give up your
General to the enemy?’ The appeal was not made in
vain. The Americans faced about and the arms were
leveled on both side—Washington between them—even
as though he had been placed as a target for
both. It was at this moment Colonel Fitzgerald returned
from conveying an order to the rear—and here
let us use the gallant veteran’s own words. He said:
‘On my return, I perceived the General immediately
between our line and that of the enemy, both lines
leveling for the decisive fire that was to decide the
fortunes of the day. Instantly there was a roar of
musketry followed by a shout. It was the shout of
victory. On raising my eyes I discovered the enemy
broken and flying, while dimly, amid the glimpses
of the smoke, was seen Washington alive and unharmed,
waving his hat and cheering his comrades to
the pursuit. I dashed my rowels into my charger’s
flanks and flew to his side, exclaiming, ‘Thank God,
your Excellency’s safe.’ I wept like a child for joy.’”</p>

<p>“This is what history tells us of another member
of the ‘Irish Brigade.’ Now, Sir, if the gentleman
from Maryland will only suppress his horror, and listen
with patience, I will tell him what tradition adds concerning
this brave aid-de-camp of Washington—this
bold and intrepid Irishman. After peace was proclaimed
and our independence achieved—after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
Constitution had been put in operation, and Washington
filled the office of chief-magistrate of the nation—he
sent for his old companion in arms, then living in
Washington’s own county of Fairfax, and invited
him to accept the lucrative office of collector of the
customs for the port of Alexandria. This tradition
will be found to correspond with the records of the
Treasury Department, on which may be read the
entry that Colonel John Fitzgerald was appointed
collector of the customs at Alexandria, Virginia, by
George Washington, President of the United States,
April 12, 1792. Thus we find that the Father of his
country, were he now living, would come under the
denunciations of the gentleman from Maryland, and
his Know-Nothing associates, for conferring office on
one of the ‘Irish Brigade.’</p>

<p>“The gentleman from Baltimore city professes great
devotion to the memory and fame of the illustrious
Clay. He was the gentleman’s oracle while living.
Hear his eloquent voice coming up to us as if from his
honored grave. He, too, is speaking of the ‘Irish
Brigade,’ and in his warm, honest and manly soul the
only words which he can find sufficiently ardent to express
his feelings are ‘bone of our bone, and flesh of
our flesh.’ ‘That Ireland,’ exclaims the orator of
America in a speech delivered as late as 1847, ‘which
has been in all the vicissitudes of our national existence
our friend, and has ever extended to us her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
warmest sympathy—those Irishmen who in every war
in which we have been engaged, on every battle-field
from Quebec to Monterey, have stood by us shoulder
to shoulder and shared in all the perils and fortunes of
the conflict.’ If anything, Mr. Chairman, were wanting
after this to ennoble the ‘Irish Brigade,’ and give
it its proper and constitutional position in the family
of American freemen, it is the obloquy of His Excellency
Henry J. Gardner of Massachusetts, and the
Hon. Henry Winter Davis, of Baltimore.</p>

<p>“I now propose, Mr. Chairman, to address myself
for a few moments to the honorable gentleman from
Missouri (Mr. Akers), who is, I learn, a minister of
the gospel. While his friend from Baltimore city exhausts
all his powers upon the ‘Irish Brigade,’ he,
with an equal stretch of fancy, but a much vaster stride
over space, obtrudes himself at a bound into the cabins
of the Irish peasantry, far away across the Atlantic.
Hailing from a State first settled by Catholics, whose
chief city was named by its pious founders after the
sainted crusader King of France, the gentleman from
Missouri calls on you to hear the Irish priest beyond
the Atlantic holding converse with his enslaved
parishioners. Mr. Chairman, from boyhood to manhood,
I have known more priests of native and foreign
birth than Mr. Akers ever saw. I have seen them at
the cradle of infancy; I have been with them at the
death-bed of old age; but, sir, my ears are only those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of a man; I never heard a word of the speeches the
gentleman from Missouri puts into their lips. Is it
not known, sir, to every candid and impartial traveler
who has visited that beautiful but ill-fated Island that
the only true, devoted, loyal, self-sacrificing friend that
the Irish peasant has in the land of his birth is the
Catholic priest? He stands between him and the oppression
of his haughty, blood-stained rulers; and
when he cannot ameliorate his condition he bears on
his own shoulders his full share of the burden. In
suffering and misfortune he administers to him the
consolations of his religion and the counsel of a friend;
he sympathizes with him in all his trials, and when
the minister of a strange faith, armed with all the terrors
of the law, sends his bailiffs and his minions to
seize the very bed on which his sick wife is preparing
to meet the God of her fathers—when under the maddening
spectacle a momentary burning for revenge
perhaps seizes upon his agonized soul—the priest is by
his side whispering in his ear ‘Vengeance is mine,
saith the Lord’; takes him by the hand, provides with
his last penny for the safe removal of the sick and the
helpless, and leaves them not until the hour of their
trial is passed—a trial that will continue to harrass and
oppress the Irish Catholic so long as the national
Church of England prolongs a life of debauchery
and vice on the plunder and pillage of the Irish
peasant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Kelly made a deep impression on the House.
The Know-Nothing members held a consultation
while he was speaking, and decided that he must be
interrupted and overcome if possible by a running
fire of cross-questions. Luther M. Kennett of Missouri,
formerly Mayor of St. Louis, and Lewis D.
Campbell of Ohio, Chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means, were selected to open fire upon him.
Mr. Kennett began by saying, “Will the gentleman
from New York allow me to interrupt him for a moment?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kennett: “I see, Mr. Chairman, that my colleague
to whom the gentleman refers, is not in his
seat. I will, therefore, with his permission, say that
I think he has unintentionally misinterpreted my colleague’s
remarks. The inference which I drew from
the argument of my colleague on this floor was that he
was opposed to the consolidation of political and religious
questions and to the proscribing of any man on
account of his religious belief—and such are the principles
and policy of the American Party. My colleague
said further that the American Party was the
first party that ever introduced that principle in their
political platform.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I must insist, Mr. Chairman, with all
deference to the gentleman from Missouri, that I have
not misunderstood the remarks of his colleague. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
listened to his speech, as I have already said, with
attention, and read it very carefully as it is printed in
the <cite>Globe</cite>, and as it now appears in that paper to
speak for itself. While I admit an apparent effort on
the part of the gentleman from Missouri to <em>look</em> liberal,
I must be permitted to remark that he seems no
way solicitous to <em>talk</em> liberal, and an unbiased perusal
of the gross libel which he has published in the <cite>Globe</cite>
concerning the Irish Catholic priesthood will lead his
colleague, however reluctantly, to the same conclusion.
But the gentleman only acts out the principles and
ritual of the midnight order, which conceals all it
can, and denies everything.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kennett: “I will answer the gentleman more
fully in my own speech, and will here state that I am
ready to answer any question he may propound.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Then I ask the gentleman did he or
does he now give his adhesion to the platform of principles
adopted by the American Party in Philadelphia
in February, 1856? If so, does not the gentleman by
his own showing concur in the principle of proscribing
Catholics because of their religious belief? I
allude to the fifth article of the American platform.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kennett: “I will answer the gentlemen by
referring him to the platform laid down by the American
Party of my State which proscribes no man because
of his religious belief. And now let me further
say that the gentleman is in error when he asserts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
that this debate was commenced by my colleague. It
was introduced by Mr. Bowie of Maryland, in his
animadversions upon his colleague, Mr. Davis.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “The gentleman certainly is in error,
for Mr. Davis himself in his wild foray against the
‘Foreign Brigade,’ unnecessarily and unfoundedly
attributed the defeat of his party in the last election
to the ‘religious influences’ which brought so many
alien citizens to the polls. The gentleman has not,
however, yet answered my question.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kennett: “I am sorry I cannot suit the gentleman
in my reply. He says the Democratic party are
a unit, that they everywhere fully endorsed the Kansas-Nebraska
bill; I say they nevertheless claim the
largest liberty in its construction, and that construction
is notoriously different in different sections of the
Union among brethren of the same political faith.
Now, the American party also needed a platform for
the Presidential canvass, and that of February last was
put forth for that purpose. If it was not perfect, it
was the best we could get, and we had to take it, those
of us that it did not precisely suit, with the mercantile
reservation, ‘Errors excepted.’ Was your President,
the present occupant of the White House, elected
by a majority of American-born citizens? On the
contrary, without the foreign vote, which was cast for
him almost unanimously, he never would have been
elevated to the position he now occupies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Suppose he was not elected by American-born
votes (which was very likely the case), were
not the principles advocated by the party which elected
Mr. Pierce national principles, without the benefit
too of ‘Errors excepted’? Was there anything in
the platform laid down at Baltimore by the convention
which nominated him violative of the spirit or
letter of the Constitution of the United States?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kennett: “I have not charged the contrary to
be so. My point is that the foreign-born vote holds
the balance of power in our country, that that vote is
almost always on the Democratic side, and thus it
shapes the policy and action of the Government. This
I consider wrong.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I will say to the gentleman that the
illiberal and narrow policy parties have pursued in
this country has contributed much to drive both native
and foreign-born Catholics in self-defense into the
Democratic party. That this is true is proved by the
fact which you know full well, Mr. Chairman [Mr.
Humphrey Marshall], that the large Catholic vote of
Kentucky and Maryland had always been found with
the Whig party, until the Know-Nothing monster
and its protean brood of platforms drove them in self-respect
as well as in self-defence into the ranks of the
national Democracy, where they have found repose
and peace under the broad shadows of the Constitution.
I will add further, that with the exception of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
two terms the administration of this Government has
been in the hands of the Democratic party. It
appears to me, therefore, that the fact that the
foreign-born population, in the exercise of the elective
franchise being always found on the side of the
dominant party, is rather doubtful evidence that they
are not as loyal to the country as any other class of
voters. The high state of prosperity which the country
has attained under Democratic rule would, I should
think, lead to quite a different conclusion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kennett: “The Democratic party have been
sharper and more successful hitherto in bidding for
their votes than we. Not that we would not have
won them too, had it been in our power. Office-seekers
are all in love with German honesty and the
‘sweet Irish brogue.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell, of Ohio: “I have no desire to interrupt
the gentleman from Missouri, or to interfere with
the very interesting colloquy between him and the
gentleman from New York. I have had something
to do with this matter of Americanism myself; something
to do with the tariff, and, like the gentleman
from Missouri, I have been a Whig. I think the
greatest statesman of America was stricken down by a
religious influence.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “To whom does the gentleman refer?”</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell: “I refer to Mr. Clay of Kentucky.
I well remember when he was last a candidate—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
1844—that there was an individual on the ticket with
him—a distinguished gentleman, Theodore Frelinghuysen
and I know of my own personal knowledge
that a priest of the Catholic Church said that because
Theodore Frelinghuysen was placed on the ticket for
Vice-President, therefore the influence of the Catholic
Church of the United States would be exercised
against the ticket.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Supposing this to be so, does the gentleman
mean to argue that because an individual Catholic
priest used such a remark it is sufficient ground
upon which to condemn and disfranchise the four millions
of Catholics in this country?”</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell: “No, sir, by no means; nor would
I interfere with their religion, even though it was true
that they had done so. The point I make is this:
That because Theodore Frelinghuysen was nominated
on the ticket with Henry Clay, who was recognized as
one of the greatest statesmen of his age, the influence
of the Catholic Church—I mean especially that of the
foreign Catholic Church, I do not include the American
Catholic Church—was brought to bear against
him; and wherever you find a foreign Catholic vote
in referring to the election of 1844 you will find, particularly
in your large cities where the power was
wielded, that the power was exercised for the prostration
of Harry of the West, for the reason, as admitted
to me in person by a priest of your church, that Theodore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
Frelinghuysen was a leading Presbyterian and
President of the American Protestant Bible Society;
and it is against that spirit on the part of foreign
Catholic influence in this country, which has sought to
control, through the power of its Church, the destinies
of this great nation that I make war.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Allow me to say that I am a native-horn
citizen of Irish parents; and I wish to say to
this House, and to the country, that no such feelings
actuate the Catholic Christians of this Republic. There
may be individual cases, but I deny that such influences
have anything to do with the Catholic population.
And Mr. Clay himself, in writing a letter on
this very subject in the canvass referred to, made a
public acknowledgement that he had as much confidence
in the Catholic people as he had in any other
religious sect in this Union. That letter was published
in a speech which I made in this House last session,
and the gentleman from Ohio can find it in the records
of the House. To convict the gentleman from Ohio,
however, of misrepresenting Harry of the West in this
matter, I will again quote the same extract from the
letter referred to:</p>

<p>“‘Nor is my satisfaction diminished by the fact that
we happen to be of different creeds; for I never have
believed that that of the Catholic was anti-American
and hostile to civil liberty. On the contrary, I have
with great pleasure and with sincere conviction, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
several public occasions, borne testimony to my perfect
persuasion that Catholics were as much devoted
to civil liberty, and as much animated by patriotism
as those who belong to the Protestant creed.’”</p>

<p>“I have already quoted from Mr. Clay’s speech delivered
in 1847, four years afterwards, enough to show
that his views and sentiments in reference to foreign-born
voters and religious creeds underwent no change.
But it was ever Mr. Clay’s misfortune to be damaged
by his friends. We have proof this evening that the
fatality follows him to the grave.”</p>

<p>In this debate, Mr. Kelly, who was the only Catholic
in Congress, sustained the concentrated charge of
the leading Know-Nothing members, and in the estimation
of the House had the best of the argument
over them all. His speech was published and read
throughout all parts of the Union, and was received
with manifestations of approval and pride by Democrats
generally, but especially by Catholics and adopted
citizens.</p>

<p>In the celebrated Hayne-Webster debate in the Senate
of the United States on the Foot Resolution in
1830, Andrew Jackson, then President, was so much
pleased with Col. Hayne’s speech that he caused
a number of copies to be struck off on satin, and placed
one of them on the walls of his library in the White
House.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The speech of John Kelly, from which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
preceding extracts are taken, was also published on
satin, and is still preserved in many households
throughout the country as a souvenir of the dark days
of Know-Nothingism, and of the gallant stand that
was made in the House of Representatives against the
proscriptionists by the future leader of the New York
Democracy.</p>

<p>During another debate in Congress—that of May 5,
1858—on the bill for the admission of Minnesota into
the Union, introduced by Alexander H. Stephens,
Chairman of the Committee on Territories, Henry
Winter Davis again attacked those he called “unnaturalized
foreigners;” and Mr. John Sherman, then a
member of the House, and at present a Senator from
Ohio, and a recent aspirant for the Presidency, declared
that “Ohio never did allow unnaturalized foreigners to
vote, and never will.” Mr. Muscoe R. H. Garnett, of
Virginia, made a fierce attack on the same class, designating
them as the “outpourings of every foreign hive
that cannot support its own citizens.” When these
tirades were made, Mr. Kelly rose to address the House
in reply, but so bitter was the native American feeling
on the subject, and especially since his refutation of
the sectarian and anti-foreign speech of Davis in the
preceding year, that John Sherman resorted to every
parliamentary quibble to cut off Kelly’s speech. “Gentlemen
here,” Mr. Kelly said, “directed many of their
arguments against emigration and against the naturalization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of foreigners. I intend to confine my remarks
to that particular branch of the subject.” At this
point Mr. Sherman objected.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman, of Ohio: “I rise to a question of
order. The rule requires that the debate shall be pertinent
to the question before the House. If the gentleman
desires to make a speech upon the benefits of
emigration I hope he will make it in Committee of
the Whole. Such debate is not in order here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “What I shall say will be pertinent to
the issue before the House.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman: “I insist on my question of order.
I would inquire whether the subject of emigration,
which is manifestly the question which the gentleman
intends to discuss, is debatable on this bill? I do
not wish to embarrass the gentleman, but desire, if he
wants to debate that subject, that he shall do it in the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union.”
This objection by Mr. Sherman to Mr. Kelly’s continuing
the discussion which he himself had just been
indulging in, shows that Kelly’s method of handling
the subject was not relished by the proscriptionists.
Elihu B. Washburn, of Illinois, afterwards Minister
to France, here interposed in favor of fair play.</p>

<p>Mr. Washburn: “I hope by unanimous consent
the gentleman from New York will be permitted to
continue his speech. He is upon the floor now, and
the matter of naturalization is involved more or less in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the merits of the question before the House.” But
Mr. Sherman was ready with another quibble.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman: “If unanimous consent be given, I
am willing to go into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union and allow the gentleman to speak,
but I must object to it in the House.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wright, of Georgia: “I would remark that the
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Jenkins) introduced
this particular subject yesterday, and occupied twenty-five
minutes in its discussion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “It is singular that gentlemen should
make objection, when it is a well-known fact that the
whole discussion on this bill has directed itself to that
particular point. But I think there is a disposition on
the part of the House to let me go on.”</p>

<p>Several Members: “There is; go ahead.”</p>

<p>The Speaker: “Does the Chair understand that
unanimous consent is given to the gentleman’s proceeding?”</p>

<p>Mr. Lovejoy: “Not unless he is in order.”</p>

<p>Mr. Morris, of Pennsylvania: “I object; because
if the gentleman is allowed to proceed, other gentlemen
must be allowed to speak in reply, and thus we
would have a general debate in violation of the rules
of the House, and I will not agree to violating the
rules of the House.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Inasmuch as there are objections I
withdraw my appeal. I do not desire to force myself
upon the House.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>Thus did the Know-Nothings wince under the lash
of John Kelly of New York. Had he chosen to insist,
he would have been heard, for he was now one of the
leaders of the House, and the majority would have
found a way to secure him the floor. He was the
most formidable enemy of the Know-Nothings in the
Northern States, for he knew how to act as well
as to talk. Dreamers and visionaries write fine
theories, but only great men reduce them to practice.
Mr. Kelly’s youth and early manhood were passed at a
period when native American bigotry and intolerance
were burning questions in State and National affairs.
He had been taught by observation, and a study of the
fathers of the government, that the best service he
could render his country was to make war on Know-Nothingism.
He had met the leaders of that party in
their strongholds in the city of New York, and vanquished
them. Before his day there were clubs and
factions, and local leaders and captains of bands—Bill
Poole and his Know-Nothings, Isaiah Rynders
and his Empire Club, Arthur Tappan and his Abolitionists,
Mike Walsh and his Spartans, Samuel J. Tilden
and his Barnburners, Charles O’Conor and his
Hunkers—but the born captain had not appeared to
mould the discordant elements to his will, and make
them do the work that was to be done. When John
Kelly struck the blow at Know-Nothingism at the
primary election on the corner of Grand and Elizabeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
streets, already described, and drove out the ballot-box
stuffers, the people of New York instantaneously
recognized a man behind that blow, and everybody
felt better for the discovery. When he ran against
the celebrated Mike Walsh for Congress, one of the
most popular characters who ever figured in New
York politics, and beat him, the native American
proscriptionists were glad that John Kelly was out of
the way, for while they feared him in local politics,
they persuaded themselves that he would be swallowed
up in obscurity among the great men at Washington,
and that he would be heard of no more. Given a big
idea lodged in the centre of a big man’s head, and be
sure fruit will spring from the seed. Kelly carried
his idea with him to Congress, and hostility to Know-Nothingism
marked his career there, as it had done at
home.</p>

<p>When James Buchanan became President, John
Kelly became one of the leaders of the Administration
party in Congress. He was then thirty-four years
old. One day General Cass, Secretary of State, visited
the Capitol, and in conversation with a friend said:
“Look at John Kelly moving about quietly among the
members. The man is full of latent power that he
scarcely dreams of himself. He is equal to half a
dozen of those fellows around him. Yes, by all odds,
the biggest man among them all. The country will
yet hear from Honest John Kelly.” These words of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
General Cass, uttered in his imposing George-the-Third
style of conversation, shortly after were repeated
to old James Gordon Bennett, the friend of Kelly’s
boyhood, and the editor took early opportunity to
mention Honest John Kelly in the <cite>Herald</cite>, and frequently
afterwards applied the same title to him. The
appellation struck the public as appropriate, and soon
passed into general use. The subject of this memoir
has been called “Honest John Kelly,” from that day
to this. In a letter to the present writer, in 1880, the
late Alexander H. Stephens said: “I have stood by
John Kelly in his entire struggle, and have often said,
and now repeat, that I regard him as the ablest, purest
and truest statesman that I have ever met with from
New York.”</p>

<p>Mr. Buchanan was urged by Mr. Kelly to appoint
Augustus Schell Collector of the Port of New York.
Other members of the New York delegation in the
House, and both the New York Senators opposed the
selection of Mr. Schell. Mr. Seward was vehement
in his opposition. But John Kelly stuck with the
tenacity of Stanton in the War Department, or Stonewall
Jackson in the battle-field. The President nominated
Mr. Schell Senator Clay of Alabama reported
the nomination favorably from the Committee of
Commerce, William H. Seward and the others were
overborne, and Mr. Schell was confirmed by the
Senate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>When Mr. Kelly entered upon his political career,
to be a foreigner, or the son of a foreigner, in New
York, in the opinion of the intolerant of both parties,
was deemed a matter that required an apology, or at
least an explanation. In 1857 one of the leading representative
men of the Federal Administration in New
York was John Kelly, and those who had been persecuted
and oppressed before were recognized and advanced
equally with all others in the city and State of
New York; and the vanishing Know-Nothings at last
realized that the absent Kelly had dealt them heavier
blows from Washington than he ever delivered in
New York. In these later and happier days men are
no longer ashamed to be called the sons of Irishmen,
and at the festive board of the Irish societies the
notable ones of the country gather to make eloquent
speeches and drink rousing toasts. But while some
men forget, true Irishmen and true descendants of
Irishmen have not forgotten their Horatius at the
bridge in the brave days of old. John Kelly, were
he a man of vanity, in contrasting the auspicious
scenes of to-day with those of the dark days of 1844
and 1854, and in viewing his own part in effecting the
change, could not fail to find much cause for pride and
complacent reflection; but vanity is not his weakness.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>John Kelly</em><br>
(AT THE AGE OF 35 YEARS.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Mr. Kelly went to Washington in the winter of
1855 to succeed the brilliant Mike Walsh in the House
of Representatives. How did the weighty statesmen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>receive him? He went into their midst a big-boned,
heavy-browed, brawny stranger, with his far-seeing
eye, and firm solid step, and as he strode in among
the Solons of Washington they all felt an instantaneous
conviction from his conversation and bearing that in
the society of the most eminent men of the Republic
John Kelly was exactly where he was entitled to be.
He flattered no great man by the least symptom of
being himself flattered by his notice. He measured
his strength in discussion with the most celebrated men
in Congress, and feared the face of none. At their
social gatherings he responded to the brilliant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mots</i>
of the wits of the capital by quiet strokes of humor,
and anecdote, and story, that sent bursts of merriment
through the circle, delighting the sensible, and penetrating
even those who encased themselves in triple
folds of aristocratic reserve.</p>

<p>There is nothing artificial about him, but he has
been always, and was so particularly in those days, the
child of nature, with no shadow of pretension or
affectation in his manners. He was not simply a man
lifted up from the ranks of toil to be noticed by the
world’s favored ones, but he was endowed with that
greatness of soul which always distinguishes its
possessor above his fellows, whether his lot be cast in
the highest or lowest situation of life. It is not
strange that New York has felt, and will continue to
feel, the moral influence of this man as long as he continues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
to take part in its affairs, loved by the masses
for his lion-like courage, and by friends who meet him
face to face in retirement for his almost womanly gentleness,
while for obvious reasons he is hated and
vilified by those who do not appreciate such qualities.
And this courage and gentleness and unruffled equanimity
come all in a breath, perfectly natural and
free, for they come of their own accord. His composure
under all circumstances has often been remarked
upon, and in the hurly-burly of New York
politics, and the headlong rush of the tide of life in
the great metropolis, John Kelly is as sedate and
recollected as the ascetic in his cloister. But there is
nothing of sourness in his temper. Reflecting much
at all times, he possesses the rare gift of thinking
while he is talking, and when he is expressing one
idea his thoughts never outrun the present sentence,
as do those of nine-tenths of people, to frame words for
the next one. He does not, in short, think of what he
is going to say next, but of what he is saying now.
Among the finer shades of character that distinguish
one man from another it is extremely difficult to define
that untranslatable something which gives to each person
his individuality; but this intentness of Mr. Kelly
upon the immediate subject under consideration, both
as listener and talker, is wonderfully attractive, and
constitutes one of the subtle forces of his character as
a political leader. This faculty of concentration belongs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
exclusively to original minds. Self-reliant, and
borrowing nothing from others as to style or conduct,
he gets at the point without labored approaches, and
acts great parts with a happy carelessness. When
others have been cast down and worried with care over
affairs in which Mr. Kelly was more interested than
themselves, his elastic spirit has not given way.
Loving thus the sunshine, he affords a conspicuous
example of the truth of the inspired words, “a
merry man doeth good like a medicine.” Nothing
has ever dispelled his cheerfulness. Defeat, deprivation
of office, desertion by those he trusted, and
who owed all they were to him, have neither embittered
him, cast him down, daunted his courage, nor
shaken his faith in himself. Domestic afflictions such
as few men ever know—the death of his entire family—have
come upon him, and while the keen shaft
scarred the granite, his constancy has remained, and
neither head nor chastened heart succumbed to misanthropy
or rebellion against Providence. Surely
something more substantial than wit, or genius, or
equable temper was required to sustain John Kelly
in the trials he has borne. The natural can only accomplish
the natural, but a good man draws from
supernatural fountains to replenish the well-springs in
the arid plains of the desert, and Christianity, not for
holiday show but daily use, must have been this man’s
sheet-anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>Those acquainted with Mr. Kelly will be proper
judges of the fidelity or shortcomings of this picture.
They who have read the absurd delineations of him in
some of the newspapers, and accept them without
more inquiry as reliable, may reject this description of
his character as contradictory of their preconceived
notions on the subject. There is a third class of witnesses—an
increasing class—perhaps more impartial
than the two former ones, whose testimony on the
point is important. These are strangers who have
formed violent prejudices against the man after reading
certain newspapers, but who on becoming acquainted
with him repudiate their own opinions as
rash and preposterously unjust.</p>

<p>“Oh!” but say his enemies, “this is not a fair test;
Kelly is plausible and fair-spoken, and has great personal
magnetism. Strangers when they meet him fall
under his spell.” The objection is a weak one, for
these strangers never relapse into their former absurd
opinions after they have gone away, and withdrawn
themselves out of his spell. Let such strangers decide
as to the faithfulness or unfaithfulness of the picture
sketched here. A case of the kind occurred at the
Cincinnati Democratic Convention in 1880. A delegate
to the Convention from the State of Rhode
Island was very severe on John Kelly. He had been
reading an unfriendly newspaper. He denounced
him as a boss, and uttered many just sentiments on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
evils of bossism. While he was speaking John Kelly
and Augustus Schell passed by, and the former was
pointed out to him. “Is that Kelly?” said he.
“Well, he doesn’t look much like a New York rough,
or bar-room bully anyhow. I have been told he was
both.” An introduction followed, and a conversation
took place between the delegate and the subject of his
recent execrations. “I am greatly obliged to you,”
said the Rhode Island delegate to the author of this
memoir, who gave the introduction, after Mr. Kelly
had parted from him and re-joined Mr. Schell. “I
honestly detested John Kelly, as a low, ignorant ward
politician, who had conducted a gang of rowdies to this
Convention to try and overawe it. So I had been
told again and again. Now I don’t believe a word of
it. I never talked to a more sensible man, and modest
gentleman than John Kelly. This opens my eyes to
the whole business.”</p>

<p>In the course of this chapter particular attention
has been directed to Mr. Kelly’s war on Know-Nothingism
as his chief claim to distinction and the gratitude
of his country during his younger days. He became
identified with the cause of equal rights in the minds
of adopted citizens of various nationalities, especially
of the Irish, and contributed as much, after Henry
A. Wise, towards the overthrow of the Know-Nothing
party, as any man in the United States. The
adopted citizens were proud of their champion, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
the place which he gained in their affections became
so deep that, like Daniel O’Connell in Ireland, he
could sway them by his simple word as completely
as a general at the head of his army directs its
movements. Mr. Kelly never abused this confidence,
and consequently has retained his influence
to the present day. Many have marvelled at his
hold on the people of New York, as great when
out of power, as when he has had the patronage
of office at his disposal. Among the causes which
have conspired to give him the largest Personal following
of any man of the present generation, his
patriotic services in the old Native American and
Know-Nothing days must be reckoned among the
chief. Such a hold Dean Swift had upon Irishmen
in the eighteenth century. Nothing could break it,
nothing weaken it, the King on his throne could not
withstand the author of the Drapier’s Letters in his
obscure Deanery in Ireland. It is fortunate John
Kelly is a just and honest man, unmoved by clamor,
not to be bribed by place or power, nor seduced by the
temptations of ambition; for were it otherwise, his
sway over great multitudes of men might enable him
to lead them to the right or left, whichsoever way
he might list, a momentous power for good or evil.
The politician who ignores this man’s influence, the
historian who omits it from his calculation of causes,
has not looked below the surface of things, and knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
nothing of the real state of affairs in the city and
State of New York.</p>

<p>Alexander H. Stephens was acquainted with John
Kelly for over a quarter of a century; came into
daily contact with him for four years on the floor of
Congress; served with him for two years on the Committee
of Ways and Means in the House; and his estimate
of Mr. Kelly’s character, referred to at a former
page, is entitled to respectful consideration from every
man in the United States, especially on the part of
those who know nothing about him except what they
have read in partisan newspapers. “I have often
said, and now repeat,” declared Georgia’s great Commoner,
“that I regard John Kelly as the ablest,
purest and truest statesman that I have ever met with
from New York.”</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">RISE OF POLITICAL ABOLITIONISM—MARTIN VAN BUREN
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE ABOLITIONISTS—JOHN
KELLY’S BRILLIANT COURSE IN THE SYRACUSE
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION OF 1855.</p>
</div>


<p>The rise and fall of the Know-Nothing party took
place when John Kelly was yet a young man. The
old Federal party and its several legitimate successors,
more especially the Whigs and Know-Nothings, had
not been fortunate in their conflicts with the Democratic
party. Founded by Mr. Jefferson, the latter
party always had been distinguished for two central
ideas—a strict construction of the Constitution, and
adherence to the minimum scale of governmental
powers. The Federalists had destroyed themselves as a
national organization by opposition to the war of 1812.
General Jackson declared he would have hung the
men who burned blue lights at New London, when
Commodore Decatur was blockaded there by the
British fleet.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> These blue lights were said to be
signals to the enemy of the movements of the American
forces. The exposure by John Quincy Adams
of the machinations at Boston of John Henry, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
British emissary and spy, who was sent from Canada
to instill treason in New England and bring about the
secession of the Eastern States,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> had hardly less effect
in sealing the fate of the Federal party than the Hartford
Convention, whose object was the dissolution of
the Union. Massachusetts—not South Carolina—was
the birthplace of the secession doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The
extinction of the Federal party was followed by the
“era of good feeling.” Then came the disruption
during the administration of John Quincy Adams, who
having first propitiated Jefferson and Madison by
making war on the Hartford Convention and the
Essex Junto, in the end showed he was a Federalist at
heart by reviving the principles which had distinguished
his father’s administration, and opening the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
way for the formation of the Whig party by fastening
the protective system on the country, and deducing
implied powers from the Constitution not found in that
instrument. The inevitable tendency of these revived
ideas of federalism was towards the centralization of all
powers, whether delegated or not, in the General Government.
The Whig party, though led by the brilliant
Henry Clay, was no match for the Democratic party.
Twice it succeeded in wresting the government from
the Democrats, but on each occasion the result was due
to Democratic dissensions, and to the furore excited
over the name of a military chieftain—Harrison in
1840, and Taylor in 1848. With Clay and Webster
the Whig party died, and was succeeded by Know-Nothingism.
Mr. Kelly’s part in the overthrow of
the American or Know-Nothing party was dwelt upon
in the last chapter.</p>

<p>But the old Federal party, so unsuccessful with the
Hartford Convention, and in its opposition to the
second war with England; so short-lived in its
regained supremacy under the Whigs; and so easily
overthrown under its bigoted organization of Know-Nothingism;
was at length about to adopt a new course,
and to acquire a new vitality in its war with the
party of the Constitution, the Jeffersonian Democracy,
destined to place it in control of the government for a
quarter of a century, and to revolutionize the institutions
of the country, if not the principles of the Constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
itself. Agitation over negro slavery furnished
the anti-Jefferson party with this new lease of
life. That agitation became the burning question in
American politics while Mr. Kelly was in Congress.
A maximum of government was now to be employed,
and the disciples of Mr. Jefferson, divided and routed,
were soon to behold the Hamiltonian school of politicians
in absolute control of every department of the
Federal Government.</p>

<p>The commanding influence of New York in the
affairs of the United States was never more conspicuously
displayed than at the time of the dissolution of
the Whig and organization of the Republican parties.
Dissensions among the Democrats of New York
proved a potent factor in this process of decay and rejuvenation
among their opponents. Prior to 1848 the
Abolitionists had no strength as a party organization.
Mobbed in Boston, New York and other cities, denounced
by Daniel Webster as “infernal Abolitionists,”
and by Henry Clay as “mad fanatics,” they
struggled in vain for long years to effect a lodgment
in American politics. A rapid glance at the origin of
political Abolitionism will not be without interest to
the historical student. Forty-four years ago, January
28-29, 1840, an anti-slavery convention was held at
Arcade, then in Genessee County, New York. Reuben
Sleeper of Livingston County presided. Among the
delegates were Myron Holley and Gerrit Smith. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
this conclave a call was issued for a national convention,
to be held at Albany April 1, 1840, to discuss
the expediency of nominating Abolition candidates
for President and Vice-President of the United
States. At the time and place appointed the first
national convention of the anti-slavery party was held.
Alvan Stewart presided, and the Liberty Party, after
a long discussion, was organized. The convention was
composed of delegates from six States. James G.
Birney and Thomas Earle were nominated for President
and Vice-President. They received a little less
than 7,000 votes at the polls, the Harrison and Tyler
tidal wave sweeping everything before it. In 1844
the Liberty Party again placed its candidates in the
field—James G. Birney for President and Thomas
Morris for Vice-President—who polled nearly 60,000
votes, and defeated Henry Clay. The politicians
were not slow to perceive that the Abolitionists at last
held the balance of power between the two national
parties of Whigs and Democrats. But no one then
dreamed that Martin Van Buren, who had achieved all
his successes in life as a Democrat, whom the South
had made President in 1836, and whom John Randolph
described as the “Northern man with Southern
principles,” would place himself at the head of the
Abolitionists in 1848, and thereby defeat his own party
at the Presidential election of that year. In this surprising
defection of Mr. Van Buren from the Democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
party, Samuel J. Tilden likewise struck his colors
and went off with the Little Magician into the camp
of the Abolitionists. Lucius Robinson also bolted with
Tilden. John Kelly followed the lead of William L.
Marcy and Horatio Seymour, and supported Cass and
Butler, the nominees of the National Democracy.</p>

<p>A convention of the Liberty Party was held at
Macedon Locke, Wayne county, New York, June 8,
9 and 10, 1847, at which the Abolitionists nominated
Gerrit Smith and Elihu Burritt for President and
Vice-President. Burritt declined, and at a convention
held soon after at Rochester, New York, Charles
C. Foote was nominated in Burritt’s place. The politicians
now began to put in their fine work. The
national committee of the Liberty Party and their outside
advisers had their own plans with which the
nomination of Gerrit Smith conflicted. They accordingly
called another convention of the Liberty Party
to meet at Buffalo, October 20, 1847. The Macedon
convention thereupon separated from the Liberty
Party, and took the name of Liberty League. Both
wings were in agreement in maintaining that slavery
was unconstitutional. William Lloyd Garrison and
his followers, while not endorsing the Liberty Party
in all things, held that a rising of the slaves in the
Southern States would be no “insurrection.” In this
view the Abolition editors concurred, as did also the
Liberty Party conventions in Massachusetts and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Eastern States, those held in various parts of New
York, and those convened in Ohio and other Western
States. The Liberty League occupied the same ground
in regard to slavery, with this difference: they took
position on other public questions which the Liberty
Party excluded from the scope of its operations.
Gerrit Smith, who was one of the single idea Abolitionists,
in fact their leader, was placed in nomination
for the Presidency at the Buffalo Liberty Party Convention
of October 20, 1847. His candidature would
have received the hearty support of the Liberty
League, for its members knew that a servile insurrection
was what he desired. Thirteen years later Gerrit
Smith supplied John Brown with the money to carry
out his notorious Harper’s Ferry raid, the revelation
of which fact in Frothingham’s biography of Gerrit
Smith led to the suppression of the book by the
friends of the latter. The managers of the convention
passed over Mr. Smith, and for the first time
went outside of their own ranks for candidates. John
P. Hale, of New Hampshire, and Leicester King, of
Ohio, were nominated for President and Vice-President.
These nominations were only temporary. In
1848 the Barnburners of New York were in open revolt
against the Democrats, bolted at the National
Democratic Convention of Baltimore, and held a
convention of their own at Utica. The anti-slavery
Whigs of Massachusetts and the followers of Joshua<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
R. Giddings and Salmon P. Chase in Ohio were ready
to unite with the Abolitionists of the Liberty Party.
A conference was held by the leaders of these various
discordant factions, secessionists from the two old
parties, which led to the call for the celebrated Buffalo
Convention of August 9, 1848. In that Convention
was born the Republican party of to-day. The Liberty
Party was swallowed up, Hale and King withdrew,
the name of Free Soil party was assumed, and two
men never before considered as distinctive Abolitionists,
Martin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams,
were nominated for President and Vice-President.
“A party has arisen,” said Daniel Webster with vitriolic
humor in a speech at Abington, Massachusetts,
October 9, 1848, “which calls itself the Free Soil
party. I think there is a good joke by Swift, who
wished to ridicule some one who was making no very
tasteful use of the words ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">natale solum</i>’:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libertas, et natale solum!</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fine words. I wonder where you stole ’em.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thomas H. Benton, the Jackson Democrat and
friend and champion of Van Buren in the long struggle
between the latter and Calhoun, added his condemnation
to that of Webster, the New England
Whig. Of the Free Soil party, which was launched
on its stormy career at the Buffalo Convention, Benton
says in his “Thirty Years’ View”: “It was an
organization entirely to be regretted. Its aspect was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
sectional, its foundation a single idea, and its tendency
to merge political principles in a slavery contention.
And deeming all such organizations, no matter on
which side of the question, as fraught with evil to the
Union, this writer, on the urgent request of some of
his political associates, went to New York to interpose
his friendly offices to get the Free Soil organization
abandoned; but in vain. Mr. Van Buren accepted
the nomination, and in so doing placed himself in opposition
to the general tenor of his political conduct
in relation to slavery. I deemed this acceptance unfortunate
to a degree far beyond its influence upon
persons or parties. It went to impair confidence between
the North and the South, and to narrow down the
basis of party organization to a single idea; and that
idea not known to our ancestors as an element in
political organizations. Although another would
have been nominated if he (Van Buren) had refused,
yet no other nomination could have given such emphasis
to the character of the convention and done as
much harm.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The vote in 1848 was as follows:
Taylor and Fillmore, 1,360,752; Cass and Butler,
1,219,962; Van Buren and Adams, 291,342. Mr.
Van Buren was assisted very warmly in this crusade
against the National Democratic party by Samuel J.
Tilden and Lucius Robinson, and having effected his
object in joining the Abolitionists, the defeat of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
General Cass, he turned his back on his new allies
in a single year and returned to the Democratic fold.
But the “harm” predicted by Benton had been
done, and the prodigal’s return could not undo it.
It was by such exploits that Mr. Van Buren won
the title of “Fox of Kinderhook.”</p>

<p>Four years later, in 1852, the Free Soil party again
held a national convention, and nominated for President
and Vice-President John P. Hale of New
Hampshire, and George W. Julian of Indiana. They
polled 157,685 votes at the election.</p>

<p>At the succeeding Presidential election the Whig
party was dead, and the seed sown at the Buffalo Convention
of 1848 by the Free Soilers had flowered in
the interval into its natural fruit—the Republican
party, a sectional organization founded on the single
idea of opposition to slavery. The mission of this
party was proclaimed by its leader. William H. Seward,
to be an “irrepressible conflict” between a solid North
and a solid South. John C. Fremont and William L.
Dayton were nominated for President and Vice-President
by the Republican National Convention of 1856.
Francis P. Blair, Mr. Van Buren’s old friend of the
<cite>Globe</cite>, was the political inventor of Colonel Fremont.
Buchanan received 1,838,169 votes, Fremont
1,341,264, and Fillmore 874,534.</p>

<p>Mr. Tilden was now back in the Democratic party,
and acting in harmonious accord with Mr. Kelly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Not so Mr. Lucius Robinson. This gentleman, whose
famous gubernatorial contest with Mr. Kelly twenty-three
years later attracted national attention, and
operated disastrously on the fortunes of Mr. Tilden,
now left the Democrats and joined the Republican
party. At a Fremont convention held at Syracuse,
New York, July 25, 1856, resolutions denouncing the
Democratic conventions, State and National, were
adopted. The committee reporting these resolutions,
of which Lucius Robinson was a member, also submitted
an address which was adopted. “Mr.
Buchanan,” it was said in this address, “the candidate
of the Cincinnati Convention, stands pledged to make
the resolutions of that convention his rule of practice.
Such a candidate, under such circumstances, we cannot
support. Mr. Fremont, who has been nominated
by the Republicans, is an acceptable choice. In his
hands the Presidential office will be vigorously and
justly administered. We have, therefore, nominated
him for the Presidency, and his associate Mr. Dayton,
for the Vice-Presidency, and will use every honorable
effort to secure their election, that we may rescue the
Presidential office from the degradation into which it
has fallen, and the politics of the country from the
corruption which is fast undermining our best institutions.”
Mr. Robinson’s committee also arraigned President
Pierce for the “deplorable misrule of the present
administration.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>For twenty years Lucius Robinson continued to be
an active Republican. In 1876 when Mr. Tilden insisted
on that gentleman’s nomination as Democratic
candidate for Governor of New York, Mr. Kelly
called Mr. Tilden’s attention to the record of his candidate,
and advised against his nomination. As Mr.
Tilden still insisted, and was himself the Democratic
candidate for President, Mr. Kelly gave Mr. Robinson
his support, in order not to weaken the national ticket.
Robinson was elected Governor. His administration
will long be memorable for the proscriptive policy
adopted by the Governor against a respectable and
powerful wing of the Democratic party. He surrounded
himself with an inner council, or star chamber,
and stretched the Executive prerogative of arraigning
and removing Democratic officials to the
verge of tyranny. It soon became evident that no
Democrat, howsoever irreproachable in the walks of
life, who did not belong to the Governor’s faction,
and who might be reached by Mr. Robinson, could
count on his safety in office, or feel himself secure for
an hour from the vengeance of the Executive. To
follow John Kelly, or to adhere to the Tammany Hall
Democracy, became an atrocious crime in the estimation
of Lucius Robinson. The revolt against Robinson
which soon took place, cleared the moral atmosphere
wonderfully, and proved that the spirit of manhood
which De Witt Clinton half a century earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
infused into the politics of New York, when he rebelled
against a similar tyranny, was still to be relied
upon in an emergency.</p>

<p>The rise of political Abolitionism presents a curious
study, and this rapid outline of its genesis has been
deemed necessary. Mr. Kelly at the juncture now
reached was in a position to take an important and
conservative part in the great anti-slavery controversy,
about which so many angry passions have been lashed,
and whose true history has not yet been written. The
Democratic party of the State of New York has
always been a quarrelsome family. De Witt Clinton
and Van Buren were leaders of rival factions; Wright
and Marcy renewed the controversy; and Tilden and
Kelly, in the present generation, inherited the local
feuds and marshalled the contending hosts of their
party in the State. Settled first by the Dutch, New
York was more rapidly colonized by the Puritans,
and later by the Irish and Germans. Contrarieties of
race sped the growth and power of the Empire State,
but produced those antagonisms among its people,
which have been more intense there than in any other
State in the Union. Clinton, sprung from Irish stock,
was at war with Van Buren, who, although of Dutch
blood, became the leader of the New York Puritans.
In the days of Jackson and Calhoun the quarrel was
revived over the disputes in which those two celebrated
national leaders, theretofore devoted friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
were embroiled by Martin Van Buren about the year
1830. Calhoun was supplanted in Jackson’s affections,
and Van Buren, thanks to Peggie O’Neil, succeeded
to the Presidency. But Calhoun’s retributive
blows in 1840 and 1844 prostrated Van Buren, and destroyed
his ascendency in the Democratic party. Stripped
of dear bought power, Van Buren resolved on revenge,
and in 1848 turned on the National Democratic
party itself, of which Mr. Calhoun was then the powerful
leader. Persons of a retrospective imagination may
indulge in day dreams over what might have been the
destiny of the United States, and over what other
and happier story the Muse of History might have
related, had Martin Van Buren restrained his
feelings, and not rushed headlong into the camp of
the Abolitionists. Pursuing the same pleasing train
of reflection, they might say—if the Van Buren
bolt had not occurred, the supreme calamity of disunion
and war, which Henry Clay and Daniel Webster
by the most marvellous exercise of statesmanship
averted in 1850, might not have taken place in 1860.
But this is all idle speculation, like the saying that if
Richard Cromwell had possessed the genius of his
father, he would have fixed the Protectorate in his
family, which Count Joseph de Maistre brushes away
with the pithy remark, that “this is precisely the same
as to declare, if the Cromwell family had not ceased
to rule it would rule still.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>John Kelly was trained in the school of William L.
Marcy, who, in consideration of his pre-eminent abilities,
was chosen Secretary of State by General Pierce,
and as the New Hampshire organ of the President,
the Concord <cite>Patriot</cite> declared, because Mr. Marcy
had “completely succeeded in re-uniting the Democracy
of New York.” Mr. Kelly occupied a similar
position to that taken by Horatio Seymour in relation
to African slavery. Regarding slavery as an evil,
Kelly believed, if the principles of Jefferson should
be allowed to work out their legitimate results without
infraction of the compromises of the Constitution,
that the Southern States themselves in time would
adopt the policy of emancipation. This was the sentiment
Washington and Jefferson<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> had often expressed,
and which John Randolph put in practice by
emancipating his four hundred slaves. Charles Fenton
Mercer, a Virginia statesman whose zeal for the
negro was no less ardent than that of Dr. Channing,
the Boston philanthropist, devoted his life to the extinction
of slavery in Virginia. In 1836 John
Letcher and Charles James Faulkner championed a
bill for gradual emancipation in the Legislature of the
same State. The Emancipationists did their share in
the interest of the black man, long before the Abolitionists
began their agitation. In estimating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
influence of the two forces upon the destinies of the
negro race, greater sobriety of statement than that of
partisans will be required for the purposes of history.
Whether the views of Senator Ingalls of Kansas on
John Brown are more correct than those of Mr.
Daniel B. Lucas of West Virginia on John Randolph,
or whether the verdict of posterity will pronounce
both eulogists at fault, it is beyond the power
of any man of this generation satisfactorily to decide.
“Scholars,” Ingalls says, “orators, poets, philanthropists
play their parts, but the crisis comes through
some one whom the world regards as a fanatic or
impostor, and whom the supporters of the system he
assails crucify between thieves or gibbet as a felon. It
required generations to arouse the conscience of the
American people to the enormous iniquity of African
slavery. The classical orators, the scholarly declaimers
and essayists performed their work. They furnished
the formulas for popular use and expression,
but old John Brown, with his pikes, did more in one
brief hour to render slavery impossible than all the
speechmakers and soothsayers had done in a quarter
of a century, and he will be remembered when they
and their works are lost in dusty oblivion.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>“In regard to African slavery,” Lucas says, “which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
has played so important a part in our political history,
Randolph was an Emancipationist as distinguished
from an Abolitionist. This distinction was a very
broad one; as broad as that between Algernon Sidney
and Jack Cade. It was the difference between Reason
and Fanaticism. On this subject Randolph and
Clay concurred; both were Emancipationists, and
both denounced the Abolitionists, as did also Webster
and all the best, wisest and purest men of that day.
Randolph was right in his denunciation of the Abolitionists.
They were a pestilent class of agitators who,
for the most part, with little or no stake in the community,
mounted their hobby-horses, Hatred and
Fanaticism, and rode them, like Ruin and Darkness,
the steeds of Lucifer in Bailey’s “Festus,” over the
fairest portion of our Republic. An exhaustless empire
of land has enabled the nation to survive this
substitution of the methods of Abolition for those of
Emancipation; but the eternal truth remains the
same, that the one was legitimate and the other internecine;
and to justify the Abolitionists, because
Emancipation followed their efforts would be to justify
the crime of the Crucifixion because Redemption followed
the Cross.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The Democratic party in New York, after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Buffalo Convention, became divided upon the subject
of slavery, and the Wilmot Proviso tended to widen
the breach. Barnburners who trained under Van
Buren, and Hunkers who followed the lead of
Marcy, although all claimed to be Democrats, were
more bitter against each other than against those of
the opposite party. The election of Franklin Pierce
in 1852, upon a platform which proclaimed the
inviolability of the Compromise Measures of 1850,
served to soften the asperities existing in the Democratic
party of New York. Before that time, Marcy
and Seymour, both Hunkers, had declared “that
opinions upon slavery should not be made a test” of
party loyalty. Daniel S. Dickinson, then a Democratic
extremist, who afterwards became a Republican
extremist, took opposite ground, and refused to unite
with the Barnburners. This led to the division of
the New York Democracy into “Hards” and “Softs.”
And it is here, after these divisions had taken shape,
that John Kelly came forward, and acted an interesting
and conspicuous part in this great sectional
controversy. His action and influence in the Soft
Shell Conventions of August 29, 1855, and January
10, 1856, although he was not a delegate to the latter
Convention, proved him to be a statesman of commanding
abilities.</p>

<p>The New York Soft Shell Democratic Convention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
of 1855 was composed of gentlemen who represented
three distinct factions in the Democratic party.</p>

<p>First, of those who had not recanted their Free-soil
sentiments of 1848, and were still simon-pure Barnburners,
utterly opposed to any compromise with
slaveholders, or the admission of another State into
the Union with the institution of slavery recognized
in its constitution.</p>

<p>Secondly, of those who had previously occupied the
same ground as the first class, but who now enjoyed
the patronage and favor of the Pierce administration
in New York, and who had abandoned their Buffalo
platform, and accepted the principles of the Missouri
Compromise of 1820, prohibiting slavery in all territories,
except Missouri, lying north of thirty-six degrees
and thirty minutes north latitude.</p>

<p>Thirdly, of those who accepted the Webster-Clay
Compromise of 1850 as a settlement “in principle
and in substance” of the slavery question in all the
territories, and who, therefore, acquiesced in the legislation
of 1854 in re-affirmation of that memorable
compromise.</p>

<p>The Union had been saved by the Compromise of
1850. Franklin Pierce had been elected on a platform
squarely endorsing it. The Whigs had not given
to it as hearty an endorsement in their platform, but
rather evaded the issue. Pierce went to the people
on this vital question, and beat Scott overwhelmingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
The verdict approached unanimity, only four States
in the Union giving their electoral votes for Scott.
The Congressional legislation of 1854, known as the
Kansas-Nebraska bill, was supplementary to, and in
strict conformity with the principles of the Compromise
of 1850, and left the question of slavery in those territories
entirely to the people thereof to settle for
themselves, with no interference from without. This
was the ground taken by Henry Clay in his last great
effort to pacify the sections on a basis just and honorable
to each. It was the ground on which Daniel
Webster took his stand so patriotically in his celebrated
7th-of-March speech in 1850. The only man
who maintained the same position in the New York
Soft Shell Democratic Convention of 1855 was John
Kelly, notwithstanding the unparalleled approval the
compromise received at the hands of the people in
Pierce’s election. John Van Buren, who had been in
company with President Pierce at the White Sulphur
Springs in Virginia—an administration favorite of
anti-administration proclivities—hastened back to
New York, and appeared as a delegate at Syracuse, to
defend, as it was reasonably supposed, the measures of
Pierce in a convention composed of Democrats who
enjoyed the patronage of the administration. But
Prince John, as Mr. Van Buren was called, displayed
his usual fickleness in this business, and went far in
his dalliance with the Abolitionists, to undermine the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
administration in whose sunshine he was basking,
and to render the renomination of that excellent President,
Franklin Pierce, practically hopeless. Without
exactly joining the Abolitionists of the Syracuse Convention
in an unqualified crusade against slavery, he
kicked over the traces of the Kansas-Nebraska bill,
repudiated the compromise of 1850, and in order to
find a middle ground to stand on went back to the
obsolete Missouri Compromise of 1820. Dean Richmond,
Sandford E. Church, and others followed Van
Buren’s lead in this matter, and voted for a resolution
he submitted taking this position. The Abolitionists
of the Convention, like General James W. Nye and
Ward Hunt, pronounced the Van Buren resolution
“mere patchwork,” and wanted to go further in condemnation
of Franklin Pierce. There was only one
man in the convention who stood up to rebuke the
slippery conduct of Mr. Van Buren, and to defend the
National Democracy from its false friends. This
gentleman was Congressman John Kelly, the subject
of this memoir.</p>

<p>Prominent among the delegates who took part in
the Convention were Dean Richmond, chairman of
the Democratic State Committee; Sandford E. Church,
afterwards Chief Justice of the New York Court of
Appeals; John Kelly, Congressman elect; John Cochrane,
Surveyor of the Port of New York; Lorenzo B.
Shepard, John Van Buren, Robert Kelly, President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
of the Convention; James W. Nye, Timothy Jenkins,
Wm. Cassidy, Ward Hunt, Andrew H. Green, Israel
T. Hatch, who was nominated for Governor, Thomas
B. Alvord, Peter Cagger, Dennis McCarthy and Benjamin
Wood. Although the Convention was called to
nominate candidates for State officers, the debate took
a wide range, and the Kansas-Nebraska troubles became
the subject of an angry discussion.</p>

<p>The New York <cite>Herald</cite> of September 2, 1855, contained
in its Syracuse correspondence a spirited sketch
of the brilliant debate in the Convention, and of the
exciting scenes to which it gave rise. A disruption
at one time seemed inevitable. “The excitement,”
said the <cite>Herald</cite>, “had been wrought up to fever heat.
There were dire menacings of a bolt. Both divisions
of the army seemed ready simultaneously to throw off
their allegiance, and go over to the double enemy.
Mr. John Kelly of New York, had thrown out awful
menacings of defection in favor of the National
Democracy, if the Convention should fail to endorse
the administration; and Ex-Lieutenant Governor
Church, Jenkins and Hunt, of Oneida, and the good-humored
member from Suffolk, General Nye, seemed
to be just as ready to march off with their hosts to the
Republican party. The remnant of the faction, if any
were left, might have divided themselves among the
Whigs or Know-Nothings, leaving only the Custom
House, marshalled by John Cochrane, as the sole corporal’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
guard of the Administration. Such a dreadful
contingency was to be avoided at all hazards and sacrifices.
The recess was utilized in endeavoring to harmonize
conflicting views, and to beat down the extravagant
requirements of the extremists of either
section. There was, therefore, intense interest manifested
in the proceedings of the evening session, and
when the Convention re-assembled at 7 o’clock P. M.,
the hall was crowded to its greatest capacity.”</p>

<p>In the preliminary stages of the Convention two
sets of resolutions had been submitted. Those of the
regularly appointed committee were reported by
William Cassidy. In these the Pierce administration
was endorsed, and the National Democracy sustained.
Minority or supplementary resolutions taking directly
opposite grounds were offered by Timothy Jenkins, a
pronounced Free-soiler.</p>

<p>Jenkins, in a radical Barnburner speech, denounced
the territorial legislation known as the Kansas-Nebraska
bill, arraigned the President, and demanded
a restoration of the Missouri Compromise. He was
answered by John Cochrane in defence of the President,
but as Mr. Cochrane had been a violent Barnburner
in 1848, his argument was handicapped by his
record. Besides, he was Surveyor of the Port of New
York, and the newspapers had often referred to a
letter said to have been written by Franklin Pierce to
the bolting Barnburners’ meeting in the Park in 1848,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
at which the standards of party rebellion against Cass
and Butler and the National Democracy were first
raised. If General Pierce wrote such a letter it was
suppressed, but Mr. Cochrane’s opponents claimed that
he was the recipient of this “scarlet letter,” as the
<cite>Herald</cite> styled it, and as he subsequently obtained one
of the President’s fat offices, uncharitable comments
were made upon General Pierce’s motives in the
transaction. But it is scarcely credible, in view of
Pierce’s antecedents, that he could have committed
himself to the Van Buren bolters of 1848. His record
in the United States Senate, and in New Hampshire,
had been that of a Jeffersonian Democrat of the strict
construction school.</p>

<p>John Van Buren addressed the Convention after
Mr. Cochrane, but as he too had been a Barnburner,
and the Rupert of debate among the bolters of 1848,
his effort now to throw oil on the troubled waters
proved a failure. Besides, it was a very halting
effort. He moved that all resolutions in relation to
the Administration, Kansas-Nebraska legislation, and
Slavery be laid on the table, but did not press the
motion to a vote, and shortly after withdrew it. The
motion to withdraw was more consonant with Mr.
Van Buren’s real sentiments than the one to table the
disturbing resolutions. The Convention was now
face to face with Mr. Jenkins’s anti-Democratic programme,
and Mr. Van Buren showed a disposition to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
support it. It was at this juncture that Mr. John
Kelly rose to stem the tide of Sewardism that was
sweeping over the Convention. With an intuitive
understanding of a scene which was constantly shifting,
but whose inevitable end, if not now stopped, he
foresaw would be the elevation of William H. Seward
to a position little short of that of dictator of the destinies
of the Union, John Kelly pointed out the
perilous levity of Mr. Van Buren’s conduct, and
made a patriotic appeal to the Convention to close
up its ranks and redeem the State from Know-Nothingism,
and the sectional Republican party. “The
firebrand of discord,” said Mr. Kelly, “which gentlemen
of the old Barnburner persuasion are now on
this floor throwing into the ranks of the Democratic
party, would have even worse consequences than their
course had produced in 1848, when they defeated
General Cass for the Presidency, and enabled the
Whigs to slip into control of the Legislature, and elect
Mr. Seward United States Senator to succeed a Democrat.
The fate of the Union now trembled in the
balance, and dissensions in this Convention would go
far to destroy the National Democracy, and place the
sceptre of power in the hands of the arch-agitator,
William H. Seward. Mr. Van Buren’s constituents,”
continued Mr. Kelly, “will approve of the resolutions
of the Committee in favor of the National Democracy,
though that gentleman may not do so. I admire Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
Van Buren’s personal character, but not his political
tergiversations. I hope the Convention will sustain
the administration of Franklin Pierce, and not divide
the Democratic party by passing the supplementary
resolutions of the gentleman from Oneida. But to
preserve harmony here I am willing to leave out all
matters relating to Kansas, and so will be the delegation
from New York city, who are prepared now to
vote for the resolutions of the regular committee.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>General Nye, former political associate of Gerrit
Smith, the John Brown Abolitionist, took the floor to
reply to Mr. Kelly. Bowie knives, and pistols, and
pronunciamentos in Kansas formed the burden of his
speech. In conclusion the eloquent but somewhat
comical General Nye declared: “I would say, President
Pierce, you have openly insulted the spirit of
your countrymen. Let us speak out and make this
declaration. I know it is our opinion, and think it is
his. I don’t think my friend Kelly would withdraw
from the Convention if we passed the Jenkins resolutions;
but if he should do so, we should obtain legions
by adopting them. The Republican Convention is
counting on our ominous silence.”</p>

<p>Another Free Soil resolution was introduced at this
point by Sandford E. Church, declaring uncompromising
hostility to the extension of slavery into free territory.
John Van Buren again took the floor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
loudly advocated the Church resolution. An administration
resolution was next offered by Lorenzo B.
Shepard, declaring that the people in the Territory of
Kansas should be left to settle their own matters as to
slavery without interference from the North or South.
A Mr. Hinckley, of Ontario County, made a violent
Abolition speech, and caused roars of laughter by
assuming a tragic attitude and declaring, “I feel like
a brave Indian on the battle field.”</p>

<p>John Van Buren, whose mission in the Convention
seemed to be to destroy his friend President Pierce,
now offered the following resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That while the Democracy of this State will faithfully
adhere to all the compromises of the Constitution, and maintain
all the reserved rights of the States, they deem this an appropriate
occasion to declare their fixed hostility to the extension
of slavery into free territory.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He supported this resolution in a long speech, in
which he tried hard to leave the Administration
without a leg to stand on. As a death-blow to Pierce,
the effort was eminently successful. In conclusion,
he moved to lay the whole subject on the table.
Having shot his parthian arrow into the side of the
National Democracy, Prince John was not disposed
to give its friends a chance to be heard. A sharp
running debate now took place between Mr. Kelly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
and Mr. Van Buren. The New York <cite>Herald</cite> published
a synopsis of it:</p>

<p>“Mr. John Kelly, of New York, hoped the gentleman
would not press his motion, but would give
other gentlemen an opportunity of expressing their
sentiments.”</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren: “I will withdraw it, for I am going
to dinner (laughter), provided you or the gentleman
who shall speak last agrees to renew it in my name.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I will agree to that if the Convention
agrees to go to dinner now.” (Laughter.)</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren: “But if the Convention does not
now take a recess, I want to make the same bargain.
I want the last man who speaks to renew the motion
in my name.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I will do no such thing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren: “Then I insist on my motion.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I expected more generosity from the
gentleman from the Thirteenth District of New York,
than to do anything of this kind.”</p>

<p>At this point a recess was taken until 3 o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>
On the re-assembling of the body Mr. John Kelly
addressed the Convention, and showed a determination
not to be choked off by Mr. John Van Buren
and the Seward contingent of Disunionists and Abolitionists,
who, notwithstanding their noisy demonstrations,
constituted only about one-third of the
Convention. He made a powerful speech in defense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
of the National Democracy, and the Administration
of General Pierce. He reviewed, in scathing terms,
the treason to Cass and Butler on the part of the
bolting Barnburners in 1848, and when he declared
sternly and with unmistakable indignation, that, if
this treason was now to be repeated he would leave
the Convention, and never again affiliate with Barnburners,
a great sensation occurred, and it became
evident that the schemes of the fanatics had been
arrested and thwarted by Mr. Kelly. A hurried
consultation took place between the friends and opponents
of the Administration. Mr. Kelly’s demand
that a delegation of true Democrats, and not Seward
Democrats, should be sent to the Cincinnati National
Convention, and that a platform endorsing the territorial
legislation of Congress in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska
bill (in effect a re-affirmation of the Webster-Clay
Compromise of 1850) should be adopted,
was reluctantly but finally conceded. The sectional
and disturbing resolutions of Jenkins, Church and
Hunt were withdrawn, and in return for these concessions
it was agreed to by Kelly and his friends
that the appointment of the delegation to Cincinnati
should be postponed to a later day, and the drafting
of an address and resolutions expressive of National
Democratic principles should be deferred until the
meeting of another convention, at which the National
Convention delegates should be chosen. In view of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
this compromise any further conflict over the Van
Buren Free-soil resolution was avoided, and it was
adopted by the Convention.</p>

<p>No full report of Mr. Kelly’s important speech,
which brought about the administration victory, was
taken down at the time of its delivery, indeed none
of the speeches before the convention was fully reported.
The New York <cite>Herald</cite>, of September 1st,
1855, contained the following synopsis of what he
said:</p>

<p>“Mr. John Kelly, of New York, took the floor.
He came here, he said, to represent the Democracy of
the city of New York, and he was determined to do
so. He was always led to suppose that it was not
upon principle, but upon personal grounds that the
Democratic party was divided. He belonged to the
Tammany Hall section of the party, but if it were
resolved to force down the throats of the Convention
resolutions derogatory to the honor of the Democratic
party, and of the administration, he, for one, would
not remain in the Convention. Let these dividing
questions, he said, rest as they are. If the resolutions
reported by the Committee were brought up, the city
delegates would sustain them. But if on the other
hand, the resolutions of the gentleman from Oneida
were forced down the throats of the body, he would
leave the Convention, and never attach himself again
to this branch of the party. (Sensation and applause.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
He asked was it desirable for one-third of this Convention
to be the means of severing the ties which
connect the party together? He knew that the constituents
of the gentleman from New York who last
spoke (Mr. Van Buren) would endorse the administration,
and endorse the Kansas-Nebraska bill. If it
were the desire of that gentleman to try and distract
the Convention, he should have come from another
district, and not disgrace that which sent him. (Hisses
and applause.) When he—Mr. Kelly—remembered
the causes of the division of the Democracy in 1848,
he thought that the ‘isms’ and those causes of division
were to be forever buried in oblivion. But they come
here again. Shall it be said that the Democratic party
of New York shall not sustain a Democratic administration?
If so, let it go forth that the administration
portion of the Democratic party of New York has
refused to endorse and sustain it. He trusted the
Convention would consider these matters well, and see
what they were going to do. They were going to
divide the party and dissever it, never to be brought
together again in its present strength. They were
going to give the power to the proscriptive Know-Nothing
party, which would bring the country to
ruin and desolation. Let them consider the matter
well, and ask their consciences whether they could do
such a thing as this. He, for one, would vote for the
resolutions endorsing the administration, and if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
were necessary to endorse the Kansas and Nebraska
bill, he would vote for such resolution, too, and he
was sure that the majority of the New York delegation
would do so.”</p>

<p>General Nye: “It is not on the issue of the Kansas-Nebraska
bill that the Democratic party of New
York can hope to triumph, nor on it that my friend
from New York city, Mr. John Kelly, can expect to
be sent to Congress in 1856.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “On that issue alone I was elected.”</p>

<p>General Nye: “It so happens, however, that the
opposing candidate voted for the bill, and you could
not have much advantage over him there. (Laughter.)
Besides, the very district which my friend Mr. Van
Buren is said to misrepresent—the Thirteenth—elected
John Wheeler, who voted against the bill.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Will you also state that John Wheeler
was elected by the Know-Nothing party?”</p>

<p>General Nye: “No: I know nothing of that party.
(Laughter.) I wish this Convention to treat the subject
in a manly way. If you do, I do not believe Mr.
Kelly will withdraw from the Convention; but even
if he does, better he should go than that the hosts that
I see around me should do so.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ward Hunt, of Oneida, made a violent Free
soil speech, in the course of which he said:</p>

<p>“Another gentleman from the city of New York, a
member of Congress elect (Mr. John Kelly), threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
to walk out of the Convention, if it happened to
adopt a course not in accordance with his views. He
would only say that if that gentleman did walk out,
his blessing would go with him, and the delegation of
the city of New York might go with him, too.”</p>

<p>Mr. O’Keefe: “Except Van Buren.” (Laughter.)</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt: “Well, I am glad to see that there is
one good man left in the city of New York.”</p>

<p>Mr. Van Buren: “I will not give notice, like my
friend from the Fourteenth Ward, Mr. Kelly, that if
the procedure of the Convention should not please me
I would bolt. Perhaps if I did, the Convention on
that very account would persist in adopting such
measures.” (Laughter.)</p>

<p>The repeated references by the leading opposition
members of the Convention to Mr. Kelly’s notice of
his determination to retire, if the Seward wing of the
party persisted in its factious course, and the concessions
which followed, showed that the blow had been
sent home. The one strong man had been found to
arrest the progress of disunion, and to aid materially
in staving off in 1856, the calamity which finally overtook
the country in 1860.</p>

<p>Had New York entered the Democratic National
Convention of 1856, distracted by intestine feuds, as
was the case in 1848, the election of the Republican
candidate for President, John C. Fremont, probably
would have followed, together with the dreadful appeal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
to arms which shook the continent four years later.
The State ticket placed in the field by the Soft Shell
Convention of 1855, was not successful at the polls.
The State was carried by the Know-Nothings by
decisive majorities. Samuel J. Tilden was the candidate
on the Soft Shell ticket of that year for Attorney
General. A short time before the election Mr. Tilden
received the following letter from Josiah Sutherland,
nominee for the same office on the State ticket of the
other wing of the party:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">New York City</span>, Friday, Oct. 12, 1855.</p>
<p class="no-indent">
<span class="smcap">Samuel J. Tilden, Esq.</span>,<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:—I was nominated for the office of Attorney
General of this State, by that portion of the Democratic party of
the State called the Hards; you were subsequently nominated for
the same office by that portion or section of the Democratic party
of the State called the Softs. I look upon the resolutions passed
and published by the Convention which put me in nomination (a
copy of which I herewith enclose) as truly, emphatically and unequivocally
expressing great principles of the National Democracy
and of the Constitution. The third resolution, as you will observe,
firmly enunciates the great Democratic principle, “That it should
be left to the people of the States to determine for themselves all
local questions, including the subject of slavery;” it expresses also
“an unqualified adherence to the Kansas-Nebraska Bill,” and a firm
opposition to “any effort to re-establish the Missouri prohibition.”</p>

<p>I approve of these resolutions and have endorsed them, and do
now endorse them in letter and spirit. Do you look upon these
resolutions as truly and faithfully expressing principles of the
National Democracy and of the Constitution? Are you in favor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, and of the great principle of the
exclusive constitutional right and liberty of the people of the
Territories on the subject of slavery, thereby affirmed?</p>

<p>Do you believe that in the organization of future Territories
Congress will have no right or power, under the Constitution as
it now is, to prevent the inception, existence or continuance of
slavery in such Territories as a domestic or Territorial institution;
that the question and subject of slavery as a domestic or Territorial
institution, in the absence of any express provision or clause
of the Constitution giving such right and power to Congress, will
and must of necessity belong exclusively to the people of such
Territories—of natural, if not of constitutional right; and that the
only constitutional and legitimate way in which a citizen of Massachusetts
or of New York can interfere with or act upon that
question, is by exercising his undoubted right to move to the
territory where the question is pending, and to become a citizen
or resident thereof?</p>

<p>Are you opposed to the political, verbal “Black Republican”
fanatics and demagogues of the North, who, using words for
things, oppose this great principle, and call for a restoration of
the “Missouri Compromise line?” Are you opposed to the State
ticket lately put in nomination in this State, headed by Preston
King, and to the declared principles and grounds upon which that
ticket was nominated?</p>

<p>The opinions, propositions, or principles which would be
implied in the affirmative answers to the foregoing questions
appear to me to be plainly expressed, or necessarily implied in
the resolutions of the Convention which put me in nomination,
and of which you herewith receive a copy.</p>

<p>Please answer these questions by letter at the earliest possible
day; for if you answer them in the affirmative, I shall take great
pleasure in immediately laying your letter before the State Committee
of the party which put me in nomination, and shall at the
same time inform that Committee that I decline any longer to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
considered a candidate. I will not stand in the way of a union of
the Democratic party of this State upon principle. The Constitution
and the Union now need the united force of the Democratic
party of this State for their protection.</p>

<p>With the most sincere desire to promote such a union of that
party, and with high regard for yourself personally, I have the
honor to be,</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
Your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Josiah Sutherland</span>.<br>

<p class="center no-indent"><span class="smcap">MR. TILDEN’S REPLY.</span></p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, Thursday, Oct. 18, 1855.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—I have received your letter, offering, on certain
conditions, to send your declension to the State Committee of the
party by which you were nominated, with my letter of compliance,
and to open to me the opportunity of running before that
Committee for their nomination in the vacancy.</p>

<p>I think that, on reflection, you will see that it is impossible for
me to entertain any negotiation, or discuss any conditions, for a
fusion of a part of the two State tickets, as proposed by you, or
of the entire ticket, as proposed in other quarters. Still less can
I initiate such an arrangement for my individual advantage, irrespective
of the other gentlemen nominated on the ticket with me,
and which, even if not intended for that purpose, may result in a
call for some of them to reciprocate your withdrawal. Discussions
as to the feasibility, propriety or terms of any union of the
two tickets belong not to me, but to the party which nominated
me, or its authorized representatives. The only countenance I
could, in any event, give to the suggestion would be in retiring
myself, and not in being made instrumental in, or even a party to,
causing others to do so. Those who have done me the honor to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
make me their candidate know that no delicacy toward me need
restrain them from anything of this nature which they think it
advisable to do. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<div>
 <p style="float: left;"><span class="smcap">Hon. J. Sutherland</span>.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
 <p style="float: right;"><span class="smcap">S. J. Tilden.</span></p>
</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that Mr. Tilden made no answer
to Judge Sutherland’s inquiries on the vexed question
of slavery in the territories. Mr. Tilden was one of
the Free soil bolters at the Baltimore Convention of
1848, and supported Van Buren and Adams in the
Presidential contest of that year. His views on the
subject of Slavery in the Territories, which he did not
disclose in this correspondence, were frankly stated
five years later in his letter of October 26, 1860, to
Judge William Kent. “I never held any opinion,”
said Mr. Tilden in the Kent letter, “which could
justify either the policy or the organization of the
Republican party. If I had done so I should not
hesitate to frankly renounce so grave an error. * * *
But, in truth, I never adopted the doctrine of absolute
and universal exclusion, by federal legislation, of
slavery from all territories, and still less that of the
exclusion of new slave States, or the philosophical
theories on which the doctrines are founded.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly’s energetic protests in the Soft Shell Convention
of 1855 bore ample fruit in the Convention of
the same party held at Syracuse January 10, 1856.
The delegates chosen to represent the Softs at Cincinnati<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
were headed by Horatio Seymour, and were
National Democrats of conservative convictions and
feelings. Mr. Kelly was a delegate from the Fourth
Congressional District. An able and elaborate address,
written by Nicholas Hill, Jr., was adopted by
the Convention, and was replete with sound Democratic
doctrine of the broadest national character. Not
a word of Free soilism appeared in it. The resolutions
were of the same conservative kind, and adverted
to the triumph of the principles of the Kansas-Nebraska
bill as shown in the recent elections. The
fourth resolution was in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Resolved</em>, That the determination of Congress, avowed in the
Kansas-Nebraska bill, to reject from the National councils the
subject of slavery in the Territories, and to leave the people
thereof free to regulate their domestic institutions in their own
way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States, is one
that accords with the sentiments of the Democracy of this State,
and with the traditional course of legislation by Congress, which
under Democratic auspices, has gradually, in successive Territorial
bills, extended the domain of popular right and limited the range
of Congressional action; and that we believe this disposition of
the question will result most auspiciously to the peace of the
Union and the cause of good government.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the principles advocated by John Kelly were
embodied in the address and resolutions of this Convention,
while those which John Van Buren had
urged were entirely rejected. Franklin Pierce was
unfortunate in the selection of his political representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
in the State of New York, at this important
juncture. He was an aspirant for renomination, and
his brilliant but unstable counsellor, Prince John,
landed him in a Serbonion bog, and left the coveted
prize to James Buchanan. John Kelly would
have proved a safer adviser for the eloquent and
patriotic Pierce. The differences between the two
wings of the New York Democracy, led respectively
by Horatio Seymour and Greene C. Bronson, were harmonized
at Cincinnati, and on motion of Mr. Bayard
of Delaware, both were admitted on an equal footing
in the National Convention.</p>

<p>It has been said that William L. Marcy desired John
Kelly, in place of John Van Buren, to be made the
mouthpiece of the Administration in New York at
this critical period. But from the day of Pierce’s
election John Van Buren had been assiduous in his
attentions to him. He went early to Concord before
the inauguration, and was closeted with the President
elect.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He was with him at the White Sulphur
Springs, in Virginia, just before the Syracuse Convention
of 1855. Mr. Van Buren was a man of varied
and fascinating accomplishments, and found it an
easy task to capture the President’s heart. Notwithstanding
the preference of Mr. Marcy for John Kelly
as administration leader in New York, on Prince
John was bestowed that distinction. William L.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Marcy, with the exception of De Witt Clinton, the
greatest Democratic statesman the Empire State has
yet furnished to the country, died at Ballston Spa,
New York, July, 4, 1857.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly won a national reputation by his brilliant
course in the Syracuse Convention of 1855. His services
in the cause of the Democracy were recognized
on all sides before he took his seat in Congress at the
meeting in December of that year. General Cass,
successor of Mr. Marcy in the State Department, introduced
and welcomed his old New York supporter of
1848 into the councils and friendship of the Administration
of Mr. Buchanan. John Kelly entered the
field of Federal politics, as a member of the Thirty-fourth
Congress, under favorable auspices for a successful
career.</p>

</div>


<p>Although a political rather than a chronological
order has been observed in the preceding chapters,
it is necessary now, for the preservation of important
threads of the narrative, to speak of some events as
they transpired.</p>

<p>John Kelly, then captain of that popular company
the Emmet Guards, was elected Alderman for the
Fourteenth Ward at the election in November, 1853,
to serve for two years, beginning January 1st, 1854.
Twenty-five or thirty years ago the people of the city
of New York selected the strongest men in the community
to represent them in the Board of Aldermen.
To attain, at that period, the place of a City Father
was an object of ambition with those who sought an
attractive rank among their fellow-citizens, and many
men were elected Aldermen who have since become
famous in State and National politics. The Boards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
of which Mr. Kelly was a member in 1854-5, were
exceptionally able bodies. At his election, November
8th, 1853, the whole number of votes cast for Alderman
of the Fourteenth Ward was 1938, of which
John Kelly received 1097; Thomas Wheelan, 566;
and Morris Miller, 275. Mr. Kelly’s majority over
all was 256. He was a member of the Committee on
the Almshouse Department in the Board of Aldermen,
and of the Committee on Annual Taxes in the
Board of Supervisors, the latter body being composed
of the Mayor, Recorder and Board of Aldermen. The
Aldermanic list for 1854 contains the well-known
names of Nathan C. Ely, President of the Peter
Cooper Insurance Company, and also President of the
Board of Aldermen; William Boardman, jun.; Abram
Wakeman, Amor J. Williamson, Thomas Christy,
Anson Herrick, Daniel D. Lord, John Kelly, Richard
Mott and Thomas Woodward. To these were added,
in 1855, Isaac O. Barker, who succeeded Mr. Ely
as President of the Board, Orison Blunt, William
Chauncey, George W. Varian, and others, the new
members taking the seats of those whose terms expired
in 1854.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly’s aptitude for affairs was soon recognized
by his fellow members. President Barker placed him
on no less than five committees in his second year in
the Board, and appointed him chairman of the most
important committee of the body—that on Annual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Taxes in the Board of Supervisors. The members of
this Committee were John Kelly, Henry R. Hoffmire
and Daniel D. Lord. The Know-Nothings were then
powerful in New York, and John Kelly was their
sleepless opponent in the Board of Aldermen. His
constituents were warmly attached to the man, and
duly appreciated his services in official life. Some
even went so far as to predict that he would soon
become a dangerous rival to the celebrated Mike
Walsh, then in the meridian of his popularity. Kelly
and Walsh both lived in the Fourth Congressional
District, and the latter was at that time representing
the District with great acceptability in the Thirty-third
Congress. The prediction was verified, and
Kelly became Walsh’s competitor at the ensuing election.
The interest which this contest excited was not
confined to the city, but extended to all parts of the
State of New York. The plan adopted in these pages
of giving outline sketches of the more conspicuous
men with whose names that of Mr. Kelly has been
associated in political controversies, certainly cannot
be disregarded in the case of Mike Walsh, that wayward
genius, gifted orator, and child of misfortune.</p>

<p>Michael Walsh was born in the town of Bandon,
County Cork, Ireland, in 1815, and came to this
country with his parents when he was a child. His
father was an intelligent, industrious, hard working
man, and the owner of a mahogany yard in Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Street, New York. He entertained peculiar
views in regard to a republican form of government,
and on that account never became a citizen of the
United States. His son Michael possessed a great
deal of talent, and was educated at St. Peter’s school
in Barclay Street. When he was about sixteen years
of age his father indentured him to a lithographer at
Broadway and Fulton Street, with whom he learned
that business. He was hardly twenty-one when he
began to be exceedingly active in political affairs in
New York, and the whole country. As an orator, for
his age, he had probably no equal. He possessed
literary ability, and was equally ready with pen or
tongue. His forte, however, was sarcasm, and unfortunately
for himself he had an unrivaled knack for
coining slang expressions. Many of the slang sayings
peculiar to New York at this day were invented
by Mike Walsh. He was naturally humorous, and
was endowed with powers of mimicry that would
have made his fortune on the stage. He could describe
the weaknesses of human nature, and lay bare the
motives which influenced public men in their actions
with a mastery which no other man of his time possessed.</p>

<p>He was elected to the lower branch of the Legislature
of New York before he was twenty-one years of
age, and although he had little or no business ability,
he distinguished himself in the House by his fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
oratorical powers. His speeches were not only interesting
and amusing, but often full of information.
Without previous thought or reflection, he could make
a capital off-hand speech, expressing his views very intelligently,
and enlisting the attention of his audience
throughout. The Democratic party in New York, at
that period, was under the control and influence of
men who had very little respect for Walsh, as his manners
were not only objectionable, but sometimes his
language was abusive. He was very strong, notwithstanding,
with the people, and on that account was
feared by the leaders. He was re-elected to the
Assembly several times. He established and edited a
paper which he called “The Subterranean,” and his
squibs, sometimes clever but often coarse, were sent
forth in its columns. There was a furniture dealer in
the Fifth Ward named John Horsepool, between
whom and Walsh a bitter feud existed. Several
times Horsepool had him arrested for libel. At last
“The Subterranean” belched forth an angrier flame
than usual, and Horsepool got his revenge. Walsh
was indicted, tried and convicted, and sent for a short
term to the penitentiary. But this served to excite
sympathy for him and increase his popularity. He
was a very companionable man, was full of anecdote,
and had a very retentive memory. He recollected,
without particular effort, nearly everything he had
ever read, and if called upon would recount a story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
or any other matter with great precision. Among
his companions, for several years, were Tom Hyer, the
pugilist, and Jack Haggarty, son of the old New
York auctioneer of that name. They generally made
their headquarters at the Hone House, a hostelry kept
by Morgan L. Mott. This was formerly the private
residence of Philip Hone, and took its name from him.
Walsh and his coterie would gather together here
daily, and relate stories and anecdotes of their checkered
experiences. Having no business occupations and
some money to spend, they all shortened their days
by the immoderate use of alcoholic stimulants. As
long as Mike Walsh survived he was the life of the company.
During the Presidential canvass of 1844 Walsh
formed a political organization on the East Side of
New York city, which he named the Spartan Band.
This body was in opposition to the Empire Club of
Captain Isaiah Rynders. Both of these clubs were
exceedingly active during the Polk and Dallas campaign,
and rendered efficient service to the Democratic
ticket. Walsh was proud of the influence he wielded
over his men, and of the power his position brought
to him as a leader. The singular notion occurred
to him of giving high-sounding titles to his several
lieutenants, and he consequently called them after the
distinguished French Marshals who fought in the
wars of Napoleon the First. All the men who were
prominent in those days in the Spartan Band and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
Empire Club have long since passed away, with the
exception of Captain Rynders, who still figures in New
York politics at eighty-one, as erect of carriage and
almost as brisk of step as he was fifty years ago.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>A curious anecdote is told of the way in which
Mike Walsh and David C. Broderick, subsequently
Senator from California, ceased to be friends. After
Walsh was sentenced to Blackwell’s Island, an understanding
is said to have been reached between them
that Walsh should commit suicide on his way to the
penitentiary by jumping from the ferry-boat into the
East River. Walsh being regarded as the champion
of the poor as against the rich, and many believing he
had been sentenced to Blackwell’s Island because of
his advocacy of the interests of the poor, his death in
the manner indicated, it was thought, would be
avenged by his followers as that of a martyr in their
cause. In view of the disgrace visited upon him,
Walsh is said to have promised Broderick that he
would sacrifice his life by drowning, and thus stir up
the vengeance of the populace in retaliation upon his
and their oppressors. But Walsh showed better sense
than to do so foolish a thing, and Broderick became
his enemy, and branded him as a coward, because he
did not kill himself according to promise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>During the summer months Mike Walsh was in the
habit of frequently sleeping all night in one or
another of the parks of the city, because, as he
claimed, the night air hardened his constitution. For
the same reason he seldom wore an overcoat in winter.
He was an inveterate joker, and was in his
element whenever he could play a trick on the unwary
or uninitiated. He was the author of the Frank
McLoughlin hoax, which all old New Yorkers will
remember. McLoughlin was a noted sporting man
in New York forty years ago, and a great toast
among horse men, pugilists, and like people of that
day. He was one of the California pioneers of 1849
when the gold excitement broke out. In a few
years he returned to New York. Mike Walsh happened
to be passing through the City Hall Park, and
met McLoughlin as he was on his way from the ship
to the house of his relatives.</p>

<p>“Well, Frank,” said Mike, “I see you have returned.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Do you expect to remain here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Frank, “I hope to spend the remainder
of my days in New York. I have been in
no place since I left here that I like as well.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Mike, “all of your friends will
be glad to see you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am sure they will, and I shall be glad to
see them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>Thus they separated. Walsh hastened over to the
Pewter Mug on Frankfort Street, Thomas Dunlap
proprietor, then known as Tammany Hall. Passing
into the bar-room, Walsh exclaimed to those present
that he had just seen Frank McLoughlin, and that
he had gone to a public-house on the Bowery, and
requested his friends to call on him there at once.
McLoughlin being a favorite, a great many persons
started out to find him, but as it was Sunday they
encountered some difficulty in obtaining admittance
to the hotel. The bar-keeper there perceived the
joke in an instant, and said McLoughlin had been at
the hotel, but had gone to John Teal’s, on the corner
of Stanton and Forsyth Streets, having left word, if
any of his friends should call, they were to go there
and see him. Walsh took care to circulate the hoax
all over the city, sending people to various points in
quest of McLoughlin, who was the bearer, quoth
Mike, of many letters and presents to the boys in
New York from old acquaintances in California.
Proprietors of drinking saloons reaped a large harvest
by selling extra quantities of their beverages to the
victims of the hoax. In sportive tricks of this sort
Mike Walsh was continually engaged.</p>

<p>In 1852 he was nominated for Congress in the
Fourth Congressional District, and elected. He served
in the House of Representatives for two years, and
attracted by his peculiar powers much attention in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
that body. He was nominated the second time in
1854 by the Hard Shells. The Soft Shells nominated
John Kelly. A very bitter and exciting contest
followed. Many thought Walsh was invincible in
the Fourth District, but his opponent was very popular,
and the struggle between them was carried on
with great enthusiasm and energy. Mr. Kelly came
out the victor, but only with eighteen plurality. The
whole number of votes was 7,593, of which John
Kelly received 3,068; Mike Walsh, 3,050; Sandford
E. Macomber, 824; John W. Brice, 626; James Kelly,
1; and scattering, 24.</p>

<p>After the election Walsh served notice on Kelly
that he would contest his seat, on the ground that
illegal votes had been cast in the Fourteenth Ward,
where the majority against Walsh was quite large.
Mr. Kelly at once acted on information that had been
given to him by a friend of Walsh’s father, the late
John Griffin, that Walsh was not a citizen of the
United States, his father not having been naturalized,
and he himself having neglected to take out citizen’s
papers when he reached the proper age. He was
not, therefore, a citizen of the United States. A certificate
of his baptism was procured from the parish
priest at Bandon, Ireland, where he was born, and
Walsh, fearing the result of an exposure, withdrew,
and the contest ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>The subsequent career of Mr. Walsh was a checkered
one. He was employed by George Steers, the
well-known ship-builder, as his agent to go to Russia
to negotiate a contract in his favor to build ships for
that Government. Walsh obtained letters of introduction
from the Secretary of the Navy of the United
States to officials of the Russian Government, and set
out on his mission with fair prospects of a successful
issue to the business. Instead, however, of conducting
the affair well, the unfortunate man fell into riotous
living in Europe, and spent the remittances his employer
sent to him. He returned to the United
States in the steerage of one of the steamships plying
between Liverpool and New York.</p>

<p>He was never a candidate for office again, after
his memorable contest with Mr. Kelly in 1854. In
the winter of 1859 poor Mike, while on his way
home one night, slipped and fell down a cellar-way
on the 8th Avenue, near 16th Street, and was supposed
to have been instantly killed, as he was found
dead the next morning by the police. Although
at the time it was thought that he had been murdered,
the evidence taken at the inquest showed that
this was not the case, and the jury returned their
verdict that his death was caused by an accidental
fall in an open cellar-way. His death called forth
expressions of profound sorrow in New York, for, in
spite of the infirmities of his nature, Mike Walsh had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
a powerful hold on the popular mind, and over his
new-made grave many an eye was dimmed with unhidden
grief, and all that was gentle and noble in his
nature was feelingly recalled.</p>

<p>Although John Kelly had been an ardent Hunker,
or Cass and Butler man, in 1848, he was now acting
with the Soft Shells, having, when the reconciliation
took place between the Hunker and Barnburner factions
in 1849, followed the leadership of William L.
Marcy and Horatio Seymour, the two eminent Hunkers,
who became Soft Shells. It was by the Soft
Shells he was nominated against Walsh in 1854.
The country was roused to a high pitch of excitement
by the Kansas imbroglio when he took his
seat as a Representative of the city of New York
in the Thirty-fourth Congress. For the first time
in the history of the government a purely sectional
candidate, sustained exclusively by sectional votes,
was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives
in 1856. This was Nathaniel P. Banks, of Waltham,
Massachusetts. The struggle was the most bitter and
protracted one that ever took place in the House,
beginning when Congress assembled on the first
Monday of December, 1855, and continuing from
day to day for nine weeks. The contending forces
were so evenly balanced, and party spirit ran so high,
that it seemed impossible to break the dead-lock.
There were three candidates in the field, and the followers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
of each supported their respective favorites
with unflinching resolution. William A. Richardson
of Illinois, who had brought in the Kansas-Nebraska
bill at the last session, and carried it through successfully,
was the caucus nominee of the Democrats;
Nathaniel P. Banks, of Massachusetts, of the Republicans;
and Henry M. Fuller, of Pennsylvania, of the
Know-Nothings. It was the beginning of the great
sectional conflict, and the ominous mutterings of the
storm were now heard in the House of Representatives
whose thunder in a few years was to break forth
on a hundred battle-fields. There was Joshua R.
Giddings, the ancient Abolitionist, who for years like
Cassandra in the gates had been uttering prophecies
of woe, and now in anticipation of victory was goading
the Hotspurs of the South to fury, such as Keitt,
and Brooks, and Caskie, and Bowie, and Extra Billy
Smith, and Fayette McMullin. There, too, were Humphrey
Marshall, Henry Winter Davis, Zollicoffer and
Cullen, Know-Nothing birds of evil, shouting their
No-Popery cry in the House, like Lord George Gordon
in the British Parliament, seventy-five years
before. There were Alexander H. Stephens, who
on the outbreak of sectionalism left the Whigs forever,
and now took sides with the National Democrats,
John Kelly, Howell Cobb, James L. Orr, and William
A. Richardson, marshalling the forces of the administration,
and striving to pluck success from the aggressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
and powerful sectionalists. They would have
succeeded in electing the Democratic candidate, William
Aiken, finally settled upon in place of Messrs.
Richardson and Orr, but for the officious intermeddling
of a blunderer, who revealed the plans of the Democrats
before they were fully matured, and nominated
Aiken in a theatrical speech which repelled the two
or three wavering votes, only needed to elect him.
This was Williamson R. W. Cobb of Alabama. In the
homely words of Mr. Stephens, as will be explained
more fully a few pages further on, he “plugged the
melon before it was ripe.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It was true that Aiken
was first nominated by John Kelly in a few tentative
words, that attracted several and did not repel any
votes. Mr. Kelly made no kite-flying speech, and the
anti-Banks Whigs, such as John Scott Harrison, Haven,
Cullen and Barclay, who opposed an out-and-out
Democrat, were interested in Mr. Kelly’s off-hand
manner of presenting William Aiken’s name, and
showed a disposition to vote for him as against Banks.
Harrison had avowed his intention to do so.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But
W. R. W. Cobb of Alabama, let the secret out that
Aiken was the Democratic dark horse, and the masterly
plans of Alexander H. Stephens and John Kelly, just
as victory was in reach, were dashed to the ground.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
An opinion further prevailed among many that one
or two Democrats were corruptly bought off.</p>

<p>On the 18th of December, 1855, after nearly two
weeks had been spent in a fruitless effort to organize
the House, John Letcher of Virginia proposed that all
the members should resign, and new elections be held.
This proposal was not made seriously, but rather as a
protest against the dead-lock. Joshua R. Giddings of
Ohio chose to treat the proposition seriously, and on
the 18th of December spoke of the Democrats as follows:
“These are the gentlemen who propose here to
the majority of the House, that we shall resign and go
home, if they will. The proposition is unfair. We
are endeavoring to organize this House; they are endeavoring
to prevent an organization. To illustrate
my idea, I will remark that I am reminded of the
criminal standing upon the gallows, the rope fastened
to the beam over his head and around his neck, the
drop on which he stands sustained by a single cord,
which the sheriff stands ready with his hatchet to cut.
‘Now,’ says the criminal to the sheriff, ‘if you will
resign, I will, and we will go home together, and appeal
to the people.’ Let me say to gentlemen, we are each
of us now writing our biography with more rapidity
than we generally imagine. Gentlemen of the Democratic
party, I say again, in your attempt to extend
this sectional institution, you have called down the
vengeance of the American people upon your heads.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
The handwriting upon the wall has been seen and read
of all men. Your history is written, and your doom
is sealed; the sentence is pronounced against you,
‘depart, ye cursed!’ I have already given my views
upon Republicanism. They are expressed in the language
of that immortal instrument the Declaration of
Independence. That is the foundation of my Republicanism,
as it is that of a vast majority of the Whigs
and Know-Nothings of the North. You, gentlemen
of the Democratic party, stand forth here denying this
doctrine. You say men are not endowed by their
Creator with the inalienable right of liberty. * * *
I would to God I could proclaim to every slave in
Virginia to-day—You have the right of self-defence,
and when the master attempts to exercise the right of
dominion over you, slay him as he would slay yourselves!”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Here then the incendiary appeal in favor of a servile
insurrection, which John Brown tried to carry out
with arms in 1859, was openly made on the floor of
Congress in 1855.</p>

<p>That Giddings was either blinded by his fanaticism,
or was a dishonest pettifogger, became clearly established
a few weeks after he made this seditious speech.
On the 18th of January, 1856, the House still being
in the wrangle over the Speakership, Mr. Giddings
took the floor, and advocated the adoption of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
plurality rule. Mr. Banks had the largest number
of votes of the several candidates. Giddings, who had
bitterly opposed this rule in 1849, now, to help his
candidate, as earnestly advocated it.</p>

<p>He said: “We have but one precedent in the history
of the Government for our guidance. In 1849
this body found itself in the same condition for three
weeks that it now finds itself in during almost seven
weeks. There were then, as now, three parties in the
House. No one party had sufficient numbers to decide
the election. No one party now has sufficient numbers
to elect.”</p>

<p>Mr. Jones of Tennessee rose to a question of
order.</p>

<p>Mr. Giddings: “I do not blame the gentleman
(Mr. Jones) for rising to a question of order. He
then stood with the party which established a precedent
which shall go down in all time to the condemnation
of his party. I mean that under the circumstances,
the Democratic party, as a party, in its caucus, speaking
by a party organ, then declared the plurality rule
to be the proper and only rule which could be adopted
for the organization of the House.”</p>

<p>Mr. Howell Cobb, “Mr. Clerk, the gentleman is
mistaken.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giddings: “No, sir; I stand upon the record.
I have the record before me, and the gentleman
must contradict that before he contradicts me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
I read from the Congressional Globe. ‘The House
had now’ says the record, ‘reached the contingency
contemplated in the proposition of Mr. Stanton. It
had exhausted the three votings therein provided for,
without a result, and had arrived at that point where,
in fulfillment of an agreement entered into between
the two parties, a Speaker was to be elected by a plurality
vote.’ Here, sir, stands the record. Now we
stand precisely where we then stood. I do not know
the number of times that we, on this side of the House,
have endeavored to follow this established precedent
that was then adopted. It was adopted by gentlemen
on the other side of the House, and under it the gentleman
from Georgia (Mr. Cobb) himself was exalted
to that chair. The Republican party stands ready to
carry out that precedent now. The Republicans stand
upon the great principle which was avowed by both of
the great parties, Whigs and Democrats.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cobb: “I corrected the gentleman in a statement
of fact. I rise now for the purpose of putting
that statement correctly before the country in connection
with his remarks. He stated that the Democratic
party had in 1849 adopted the plurality resolution in
caucus. The truth is simply this: the plurality rule
was adopted in caucus by the Whig party. When it
was reported by the Committee of Conference of the
two parties to the Democratic caucus, it was rejected
there by a decided majority. And, if he desires to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
stand by the record, there was no man on the floor more
violent or more denunciatory of the operation of the
plurality rule than the gentleman from Ohio. My
recollection is that he offered a substitute for it, which
declared that it was wrong in principle, dangerous in
its tendency, and ought not to be adopted.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giddings: “I only repeat what was said by a
leading member of the Democratic party, the Hon.
Mr. Stanton, of Tennessee, on this floor, and in the
presence of the gentleman from Georgia, and his party
in this House. That gentleman sat silently in his seat
when Mr. Stanton declared the plurality rule to have
been agreed to by the Committee, and he did not
deny it; no member of his party denied the fact. I
call the attention of the country to the fact that in
their caucus the Democratic party, as a party, agreed
with the Whig party, as a party, that this should be
the rule. I do not involve gentlemen; I only involve
the Democratic party. I mean to pin it on that
party.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edmundson: “Anybody who asserts that the
Democratic party agreed to adopt the plurality rule,
asserts what is not true.”</p>

<p>Mr. Orr: “I was present on the occasion to which
I suppose reference is made; and I state distinctly
that no such resolution as that referred to by the gentleman
from Ohio was adopted by the Democratic
caucus, either directly or indirectly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Millson, and other members who had attended
the Democratic caucus of 1849, made similar denials.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobb: “Fortunately the gentleman from Tennessee
(Mr. Stanton), although not a member of this
House, is here, and I assert, without one word of
conference with him, that he never intended to say
before this House, nor did a single member of the
House at that time so construe his language—that the
Democratic party had adopted the plurality rule in
caucus.”</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Jones, of Tennessee, referred to
the <cite>Globe</cite> of 1849, and showed that the words put in
Mr. Stanton’s mouth by Mr. Giddings had not been
used by him at all, but were words of the reporter
distinctly employed in another connection. This revelation,
so damaging to Mr. Giddings’s character for
fair dealing, was clinched by Mr. Letcher, who quoted
from a speech made in the House by Mr. Giddings
himself, in 1849, five days after the adoption of the
plurality rule, in which he declared the Whig party
had forced the rule upon the House. Having quoted
the passage from Mr. Giddings’s speech contradictory
of himself, Mr. Letcher remarked: “Now, Sir, I submit
that whatever may have been the opinion of other
people, it does not become the gentleman from Ohio
to rise here in his place, and undertake to charge that
the Democratic party adopted that rule, after he has
sent out to the country and published a speech, revised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
and printed in pamphlet form, in which he purports
to give the facts as they occurred in 1849.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giddings: “I repeat what I said when I
first rose, that the Democratic party in its caucus,
speaking through its committee, did agree to the
resolution.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edmundson: “I want to let the gentleman
from Ohio know that he is asserting what is not true.
I am stating facts within my own knowledge. The
Democratic caucus voted down the resolution, and
refused to adopt it. Now, any statement made in
conflict with that, I say this from my own personal
knowledge, is a statement which is not true, and he
who makes it knows, at the time he is making it, that
it is not true.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giddings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Go, show your slaves how choleric you are,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And make your bondmen tremble,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">but do not come here to make any imputations upon
me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edmundson (advancing towards Mr. Giddings,
who had sprung Shakespeare on him unexpectedly):
“I want to hear what the gentleman from Ohio is
saving.”</p>

<p>Mr. Giddings: “Let gentlemen keep cool.”</p>

<p>Mr. Edmundson: “I will keep cool, if you will
state the facts.”</p>

<p>At this point there were loud cries of “Order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
order,” and much confusion and excitement in the
hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobb: “When the gentlemen from Ohio stated
that the Democratic party had adopted as a party the
plurality rule, I unhesitatingly denied that statement.
When he said that the resolution was introduced by
Mr. Stanton, he read the language of Mr. Stanton to
show that he made the statement to the House, and to
the country, to that effect. I stated then that it was
a misconstruction of the language of Mr. Stanton, and
that it must have been so from the facts as they were.
Now, Mr. Clerk, I ask this House, and I put it to the
candor of every man on this floor, if, at the time this
declaration was made, it was not its understanding
that the language quoted was the language of Mr.
Stanton?”</p>

<p>Several members: “He so stated, expressly.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cobb: “I put it to the memory and candor of
gentlemen here, if the gentleman from Ohio did not
so intend it, then he made a charge against the party
without any particle of ground to stand on. If he
did intend it, it was an effort to falsify the record
on which he was standing. This language was the
language of the reporter, giving an account of the
proceedings of the day, and does not occur in connection
with Mr. Stanton’s name at all. There is a vote
intervening between the time when Mr. Stanton addressed
the House, and the remarks here made by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
reporter, which had no earthly connection with them
whatever. Where, then, is the point of the gentleman’s
remarks when he charges me with sitting by
and allowing Mr. Stanton to state that the plurality
proposition was the result of an agreement between
the two parties, unless it be because he had put in Mr.
Stanton’s mouth the language of the reporter? I
submit the facts to the House; I shall not characterize
them.”</p>

<p>Mr. Orr: “Since the debate commenced, Mr. Stanton
has come within the limits of this hall. I have
had an interview with him, and he has authorized me
to state, that when the proposition to elect by plurality
was presented to the Democratic caucus, it was
almost unanimously rejected by them, and that when
he offered the plurality resolution he did it upon his
own individual responsibility.”</p>

<p>These crushing refutations of the charges of Mr.
Giddings raise a strong doubt of his honesty in this
matter. He was a sharp politician, and sought without
regard to the means to elect Mr. Banks Speaker
of the House.</p>

<p>The Know-Nothings, recruited as were the Republicans
from the same parent stem of John Adams
Federalism, were the allies of the Sectionalists led by
Mr. Giddings in 1856. The folly of the Southern
Know-Nothings in the great conflict over the Speakership
in the Thirty-fourth Congress was remarkable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Some of them, like Zollicoffer and Humphrey Marshall,
were afterwards such violent Secessionists that
they became Generals in the Confederate army. Even
Henry Winter Davis was so much opposed to the
Republican party at this time, and for several years
after, that he denounced it as a miserable, useless
faction, and sneeringly asked, “Why cumbers it the
ground?” Mr. Zollicoffer, a Southern man, of no
mean powers, with surprising inconsistency refused
to vote for a Democratic candidate for Speaker when
none other had the remotest chance to beat Banks,
and at the same time inveighed against Mr. Campbell,
a Pennsylvania Know-Nothing, for voting for Banks,
and thereby aiding the Sectionalists in opening the
door for disunion and civil war. These men and
their congeners in bigotry, like the blood-stained
fanatic Lord George Gordon before them, strove to
excite a religious war, and preached proscription of
foreigners, and persecution of Catholics in the American
Congress. No union with slaveholders, was the
platform of Joshua R. Giddings; no-Popery, and no
citizenship for foreigners, the platform of Henry Winter
Davis.</p>

<p>“I go against the Catholics,” said Mr. Cullen of
Delaware, during the same Speakership contest. “I
never will support them. They are not fit to be supported
by Americans. The people of the State from
which I come look upon them with abhorrence. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Catholic priest, a short time ago, came among us. He
was a stranger. He taught the doctrine of purgatory.
After he had proclaimed that doctrine, an honorable
gentleman of the State of Delaware, and who at the
last election ran for Governor on the same ticket with
myself, declared that he ought to be egged! I vote
against the Catholics!”</p>

<p>Mr. Dowdell, of Alabama: “I am exceedingly
pained at the spectacle which has been presented to-night.
When Rome was burning Nero was fiddling
and dancing. Now, sir, we are standing upon a slumbering
volcano. Upon our borders in the common
territory of this country, our people are marshalling
their forces to try the great question whether they are
able to govern themselves, it may be with rifles in
their hands. I have been reminded by the ludicrous
scenes witnessed here of a parallel to be found in a
book entitled, ‘Georgia Scenes.’ Ned Brace, the hero
of the story, happened to be in a city during the prevalence
of a great fire, the flames in red volumes were
rising higher and higher each moment, the people
were running to and fro in great consternation, women
and children were screaming through the streets, and
the midnight fire-bells were sending out their rapid
and startling sounds, when Ned quietly took his position
on the sidewalk. About this time a large old
man, nearly out of breath, came running by in great
haste, whose home was threatened with destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
perhaps, and was abruptly stopped by Ned with the
interrogatory: ‘Sir, can you tell me where I can find
Peleg Q. C. Stone?’ ‘Damn Peleg Q. C. Stone, my
house is on fire;’ was the impatient reply. Now, sir,
while the fire of civil war is threatening to be kindled
upon our borders, questions are propounded here quite
as impertinent at this time of danger, and calculated
to provoke similar impatience, if not a similar reply.
I have no fear that any party in this country opposed
to religious liberty will ever be strong enough to control
its legislation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Paine, of North Carolina: “I ask whether any
gentleman in this House is willing to see the Government
of the United States, and the Congress of the
United States, in the hands of the Roman Catholics of
this country? This is a matter which enters into the
private feelings, however unwilling members may be
to expose it. These very gentlemen themselves would
not trust the government of the country and Congress
in the hands of Roman Catholics.”</p>

<p>Mr. Valk, of New York: “The honorable gentleman
from Alabama (Mr. Dowdell) took occasion to
draw the attention of the House to the once living
embodiment of that portrait on my right—that of La
Fayette. I frankly and freely do honor to his memory.
But the gentleman forgets one remark which fell from
the lips of that man when living. He said: ‘If ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the liberties of this country are destroyed it will be by
Catholic priests.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Bowie of Maryland: “Sparks says that is a
lie.”</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Kelly tried to get the floor to
repel the furious assaults of the Know-Nothings upon
his church, of which the preceding extracts are but a
few specimens.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I should like to explain my vote.”</p>

<p>The Clerk: “The clerk would remind the gentleman
from New York that it is too late. He can proceed,
however, if no objection is made.” There were
loud cries of “object!”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Does the Clerk decide that I am not
in order?”</p>

<p>The Clerk: “The Clerk makes no decision.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pennington: “I move that the gentleman from
New York (Mr. Kelly) have leave to explain his vote,
and I do so because the gentleman is a Catholic, and
the only one I believe of that faith upon this floor. I
think that under the circumstances it would be only
common courtesy to hear him.” Loud cries of “Hear
him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bowie: “Hear him; he is the only Catholic
here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Washburn: “I will yield to the gentleman for
ten minutes.” Mr. Kelly, without previous preparation,
now proceeded to make his second speech in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
House, January 9, 1856, his first having been delivered
December 19, 1855, in reply to Mr. Whitney,
a New York Know-Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I am aware, Mr. Clerk, that it is very
improper to bring religious matters into legislative
business at all but when I hear such remarks as have
fallen from the intelligent gentleman who has just
spoken, I feel that it becomes me, as a member of the
religious body which the gentleman has been assailing,
to say something, at least, in its defense.</p>

<p>“The accusation is made here that the Catholic religion
is dangerous to the institutions of this Republic.
Sir, no man possessed of any intelligence would give
any weight to a charge of that sort. When have
the Catholic clergy urged their flocks to support particular
individuals for office? When have they from
their pulpits urged their congregations to support particular
measures, or to vote for particular men? There
is not in the history of this country an instance in
which the Catholic clergy have so acted. But can the
same be said of other religious denominations in this
country? In the Eastern portion of the Union you
will frequently find ministers from their pulpits invoking
their flocks to vote for measures which interest
them, and the section of the Union to which they belong.
Now, Mr. Clerk, I am a Catholic, and I love
this Union. I defy any man in this Congress to say
that he is a better citizen, or more devoted to the true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
interests of this Union than I am. This is not only
my sentiment, but it is the sentiment of the religious
body to which I belong. It is the sentiment of our
priesthood.</p>

<p>“I let the accusation that the Catholic religion is
dangerous to our beloved country, go for what it is
worth; for I am satisfied that no sane man would
make such an assertion. But this charge has been frequently
made since we first met here. When my colleague,
Mr. Valk, made several charges against the
Catholic religion, I had not an opportunity to say one
word in reply but, sir, I am surprised that the gentleman
from Long Island, a man of intelligence and a
Christian, as I take him to be, should rise upon
this floor, and denounce his fellow Christians because
he differs with them in opinion upon religious
questions.” Mr. Valk, who had indulged in such
denunciation, nevertheless, made a denial at this
point.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “The gentleman from North Carolina,
Mr. Paine, asks, would you like to see this Government
in the hands of the Catholic people? Suppose
that it was in the hands of the Catholic people, have
the Catholic people of this Union ever been false to
its true interests? Why, sir, look at the early history
of our country, and look to that State which borders
upon this District. A Catholic community existed
there, which extended a liberality to all other religions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
that could not be found in other colonies at that time.
While Calvert, Lord Baltimore, was founding a free
colony there, religious persecution was going on in
other colonies; and when people were persecuted in
other colonies, where did they go that they might worship
God according to the dictates of their own consciences?
They came to the Catholic colony of Maryland.
These are the Catholic people to whom the
honorable gentleman from Alabama has referred.
Such, sir, is the history of the Catholics in this country,
and such has it ever been. These people when they
leave their homes in Germany, in Ireland, or in whatever
country they may be found, and come here, it
is to make this country their home. They imbibe the
spirit of true patriotism before they leave the Old
World. They come here with their parents,
brethren, and friends, because here they can enjoy
their liberty. And tell me, sir, is not the assertion,
that they are inimical to your liberties unfounded?
Are not the people who make it blinded by prejudice
and bigotry? Why, sir, foreigners have always
composed a large portion of the army of the country.
They have fought side by side with our native-born
citizens in every battle that has been fought from the
earliest period of our existence as a nation, down to
the present time. They have been working in a common
cause to promote common objects—the blessings
and prosperity of this Union. Let me say to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
House, if they come not here with wealth, they come
with willing hands to work and earn their bread upon
your public works, from their very commencement to
their completion. How could your great public works
have been constructed without these men?”</p>

<p>The Know-Nothings, not liking Kelly’s argument,
at this point made a determined effort to cut him off.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell Sage, of New York: “I move that this
House do now proceed to vote for Speaker, and upon
that motion I demand the previous question.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, of Alabama: “I hope the gentleman
from New York, Mr. Kelly, will be allowed to proceed
with his explanation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Eustis, of Louisiana: “I hope Mr. Kelly will
be allowed to proceed by unanimous consent.”</p>

<p>Several members objected.</p>

<p>Mr. Leiter, of Ohio: “I appeal to the House
to withdraw all objection, and allow the gentleman
from New York to go on with his speech.” Objection
was again made.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I do not care about proceeding further.
I wished to deny the charges made by the gentleman
from North Carolina, Mr. Paine, and by the gentleman
from New York, Mr. Valk, and having done that
I am satisfied to let the matter rest for the present.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kelly, had he not been cut off by objections,
intended to read the letter of La Fayette, written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
from Paris in 1829 to a Protestant citizen of New
York, whose guest the old patriot had been during
his last visit to this country. This letter Mr. Valk
had grossly perverted. At the earliest opportunity
during that session Mr. Kelly replied to Mr. Valk
and Mr. Smith, and read the La Fayette letter. The
sentences in it which Mr. Valk had so garbled were
in reality as follows:—“But I must be permitted to
assure you that the fears which in your patriotic zeal
you seem to entertain, that if ever the liberty of the
United States is destroyed it will be by Romish priests,
are certainly without any shadow of foundation whatever.
An intimate acquaintance of more than half
a century with the prominent and influential priests
and members of that Church, both in England and
America, warrant me in assuring you that you need
entertain no apprehension of danger to your republican
institutions from that quarter.”</p>

<p>In the last chapter the strange spectacle was presented
of Southern Know-Nothings, while declaring
their opposition to the Abolitionists, actually aiding
them to elect a Speaker, and offering as an excuse for
their conduct the dread that the Catholic Church
might obtain control of the Government! The Democratic
caucus had adopted a resolution denouncing the
enemies of civil and religious liberty. Humphrey
Marshall and the Southern Know-Nothings declared
this was an insult to them, and not only Marshall,
but Cox of Kentucky, and Zollicoffer and Etheridge
assigned the same cause as presenting an insuperable
obstacle to their voting for any Democrat for Speaker.
The Know-Nothings and Abolitionists, having nothing
in common, united to overthrow the party of the
Constitution, the former to prevent the Catholics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
from seizing the Government, the latter to get rid
of slavery. This ridiculous pretext of the Know-Nothings
concerning the political ambition of the
Catholic Church was most effectively answered by
the fact that out of the whole 234 members of the
House, and 7 Territorial Delegates, John Kelly was the
only Catholic in the Thirty-fourth Congress. Mr.
Kelly declared truly that no sane man would offer
such an insult to the intelligence of the country, as a
justification for his conduct, but Davis of Maryland,
Cullen of Delaware, Whitney of New York, and other
proscriptionists were wedded to their idols, and in order
to strike down an imaginary enemy, they became
the tools of a real one.</p>

<p>For nine weeks the stubborn contest continued.
The country, from one end to another, was roused to
feverish excitement. It was the first time the Republican
party had shown front in a National contest.
Ever since the Seward-Fillmore quarrel had led to the
overthrow of the Whig party in 1853, the Freesoilers
had been a heterogeneous mass of the Northern population,
unorganized, and with no common object in
view. Mr. Seward keenly felt that success in the present
struggle for the Speakership was vital to the perpetuity
of the Republican party. He summoned to
Washington his ablest friends, Thurlow Weed, Horace
Greeley and James Watson Webb. These four famous
leaders soon organized their followers in the House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
into a compact body. Mr. Zollicoffer, who subsequently
became a Secessionist, and fell in battle as a
Confederate General, characterized them by name on
the floor of the House as the chiefs of the lobby. In
the course of a speech on the 20th of December, in
which he declared, with a short-sightedness unworthy
of so clever a man, that he would not vote for a Democrat
against Banks, Zollicoffer said: “I see here a great
organization, numbering from one hundred and four
to one hundred and six members, who are steadily
voting for Mr. Banks. Whilst I have reason
to believe that the great lobby spirits who control
that organization are Greeley and Seward,
and Weed and Webb, men of intellect and
power at the North, who are as bitterly opposed to the
American party as they are to the Democratic party,
I do, upon my conscience, believe that there are gentlemen
voting for Mr. Banks, from day to day, who do
not belong to the Abolition, or, as they style themselves,
the Republican organization. For example, I
cite the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Campbell),
at whose position, as he announced it here the other
day, I was surprised. He says he is an American, and
he spurned the idea that the American party at the
North were identified with the Freesoilers of the
North and yet he casts his vote steadily against a
conservative National American of his own State, and
gives it to Mr. Banks, a Free Soil Democrat, who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
affiliated, as his record clearly shows, with the most
ultra and violent Free-soil and Abolition factions.”</p>

<p>The Capitol was alive with intrigues and with intriguers
from every part of the country. The leaders
retired to the Committee rooms day by day, and night
by night, and runners kept them constantly informed
of the movements of their adversaries. Counter-movements
followed, and new plans succeeded each
other on every side without avail. It was an interesting
moment for the historian; the events of the hour
were big with the fate of the country. Federalism
and Democracy were once more, as in the year 1801,
locked in a death struggle. Then, as now, it was the
party of the Constitution against the party of Centralization.
The Know-Nothings held the balance of
power, and of course the followers of the man who
wrote his own epitaph in these words, “Author of
the Declaration of Independence, and of the Statutes
of Virginia for Religious Freedom,” had nothing to
expect from that pestilent band of bigots. Sprung
from the same parent stem of John Adams Federalism,
Joshua R. Giddings and his Abolitionists, and
Henry Winter Davis and his Know-Nothings, were
natural allies against the disciples of Jefferson.</p>

<p>Seward, Weed and Greeley, to their credit be it
recorded, having led the anti-Know-Nothing branch
of the Whig party in New York, were not personally
influential with members of the American party in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Congress. But the Republican leaders were men of
varied resources, and Thurlow Weed, the Whig Warwick,
was equal to any emergency. The fierce philippics
of Henry A. Wise against the Know-Nothings
in the memorable Virginia campaign just closed, and
the tremendous blows which Alexander H. Stephens
had dealt the party of dark lanterns in his then recent
Georgia campaign, were artfully spread abroad among
the proscriptionists in Congress, and the bitterness of
their defeat in both those States added to the chagrin
which the unanswerable arraignments of Wise and
Stephens excited among them. The resolutions of the
Democratic caucus, especially the one denouncing the
enemies of civil and religious liberty, and the alleged
contradictory constructions placed upon the Kansas-Nebraska
bill by Northern and Southern Democrats,
were also used by the Seward men as electioneering
appeals for Mr. Banks. In one or two Democratic
quarters the Republican leaders were strongly suspected
of employing corrupt appliances.</p>

<p>The great anti-Know-Nothing speech of Alexander
H. Stephens at Augusta, largely quoted from in a
former chapter of this book, was now being used by
the Republicans to increase Know-Nothing enmity to
the Democrats. On his part Mr. Stephens was a tower
of strength to the Administration men in the House.
He appreciated the magnitude of the struggle, and was
indefatigable in his attempts to defeat the Republican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
and Know-Nothing alliance. He rejoiced at the prominence
which the Republican leaders were giving to
the victory over Know-Nothingism in his own State.
“I think,” he said in a letter to his brother, “the
Georgia election is more talked of than that of any
other State in the Union.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Lewis Cass, Stephen A. Douglas, C. C. Clay, R. M.
T. Hunter, Judah P. Benjamin, and other Democratic
Senators, were in frequent consultation with Alexander
H. Stephens, John Kelly, Howell Cobb, James L. Orr,
William A. Richardson, and other Democratic members
of the House. The relative strength of the two
leading parties in the House, seventy-four Democrats
and one hundred and four Republicans, was the subject
of anxious thought, and all at length saw that Mr.
Richardson, the caucus nominee of the Democrats, could
not be elected. He was, therefore, dropped, and James
L. Orr substituted as the Democratic candidate. As
week after week elapsed, it became evident that the
dead-lock could only be broken by the abandonment of
a straight party man by the Democrats. Even then
no election was likely to take place unless the plurality
rule should be adopted. About ten days before the
end of the contest, as alluded to already, a private consultation
took place between Mr. Stephens, Mr. Kelly,
Mr. Orr, and Mr. Cobb, at which the nomination of
William Aiken of South Carolina was decided upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
as that of the only available candidate against Banks.
But in order to render this movement effective, the utmost
secrecy was necessary until the time should have
come to bring out the new candidate. This plan originated
with Mr. Stephens. Mr. Kelly entered heartily
into it. To him was assigned the important duty
as a Northern Democrat of putting Mr. Aiken in
nomination. He was only to do this, when Banks’s
election should appear imminent, or after the plurality
rule had been adopted, with Orr still running against
Banks. The nomination was not to be enforced by
any set speech on the part of the mover, which might
show design and premeditation, but was to be made as
if on the impulse of the moment, and as the sudden act
of an individual who had given up all hope for Orr,
and now named Aiken as a sort of dernier resort to
beat Banks.</p>

<p>It showed that the Democratic leaders reposed extraordinary
confidence in Kelly’s coolness, tact and good
judgment, that he should have been selected to initiate
this most delicate parliamentary move. Mr. Orr had
agreed to withdraw at the proper moment in Aiken’s
favor. In the meantime Mr. Stephens was to manage
the preliminary strategy necessary to put the train of
affairs in motion. He sounded various members in
casual conversation, and found men of the most opposite
views quite favorable to Aiken, as a compromise
candidate against Banks. At length, February first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
when it seemed probable that Banks would be elected,
and at the right moment, with admirable brevity and
effect, John Kelly rose and nominated Aiken. But
before Orr could get the floor to withdraw in favor of
Mr. Kelly’s nominee, Williamson R. W. Cobb, of Alabama,
who had found members who were in the secret
predicting that Aiken would win, now sprang up and
in a cut-and-dried-speech, and with a great parade of
theatrical language, declared that the time had arrived
to name the winning man, that he had the pleasure of
offering an olive-branch to all those who opposed the
Republicans, and after giving everybody to know that
he was about to announce a grand parliamentary stroke
on the part of the Democrats, he nominated William
Aiken of South Carolina. The effect of that supremely
ill-timed speech was to drive off votes which Mr.
Aiken would have otherwise won, for as soon as it
dawned upon the Whigs and Know-Nothings, who had
not gone over to Banks, that the latest move was a
Democratic “olive-branch,” a sufficient number of
them reconsidered their intention to vote for Aiken,
and Banks was elected Speaker the next day, under
the operation of that extra-constitutional device—the
plurality rule.</p>

<p>The votes of John Hickman and David Barclay,
two Democrats from Pennsylvania, were not given on
the final ballot to the candidate supported by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Democratic side of the House. They were much
censured for their course.</p>

<p>The Congressional Globe contains the following:</p>

<p>“House of Representatives, Friday, February 1,
1856.</p>

<p>Mr. Ball. I offer the following resolutions, and upon
it I demand the previous question:</p>

<p>Resolved, That Nathaniel P. Banks, of Massachusetts,
be, and he is hereby declared Speaker of this
House for the Thirty-fourth Congress.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly. I desire to offer a substitute for that
resolution.</p>

<p>The Clerk. It is not in order to do so now, as the
previous question has been demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly. Then I give notice, that if the pending
resolution is voted down, I shall hereafter offer the
following:</p>

<p>Resolved, That William Aiken, of South Carolina,
be, and he is hereby elected Speaker of this House, for
the Thirty-fourth Congress.”</p>

<p>The resolution declaring Banks the Speaker was
lost by 102 ayes to 115 noes. Then, before Mr. Kelly
could obtain the floor to name Mr. Aiken, Williamson
R. W. Cobb made his fatal olive-branch speech in favor
of Aiken, and Mr. Washburne of Illinois moved to
lay “that olive branch on the table.” The House by
a vote of 98 to 117 refused to table the resolution.
The main question of declaring Aiken Speaker was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
then put and lost, ayes 103, noes 110. It will be observed
that the vote for Aiken was larger than that for
Banks. Banks 102 to 115; Aiken 103 to 110. Mr.
Kelly would have had the honor of naming the Speaker
but for the precipitancy of Mr. W. R. W. Cobb. The
plurality rule, a device of doubtful constitutionality, was
adopted the next day, February 2d, and Banks was
elected. The following was the vote: Banks 103;
Aiken 100; Fuller 6; Campbell 4; Wells 1. If Henry
Winter Davis and the other five Know-Nothings who
voted for Fuller, or even three of them, had supported
Mr. Aiken, his election would have taken place.
Or if only two of those Know-Nothings, and the
two Democratic back-sliders, Hickman and Barclay,
had voted for Aiken, the defeat of Banks, and election
of the Democratic candidate, in this momentous national
contest would have resulted.</p>

<p>“After a prolonged struggle,” says Mr. Blaine in
his <cite>Twenty Years of Congress</cite>, “Nathaniel P. Banks
was chosen Speaker over William Aiken. It was a
significant circumstance, noted at the time, that the
successful candidate came from Massachusetts, and the
defeated one from South Carolina. It was a still more
ominous fact that Banks was chosen by votes wholly
from the free States, and that every vote from the slave
States was given to Mr. Aiken, except that of Mr.
Cullen of Delaware, and that of Henry Winter Davis
of Maryland, who declined to vote for either candidate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
It was the first instance in the history of the Government
in which a candidate for Speaker had been chosen
without support from both sections. It was a
distinctive victory of the free States over the consolidated
power of the slave States. It marked an
epoch.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> If William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed
were here to explain this “distinctive victory,” as Mr.
Blaine calls it, they might, if they were in a confessing
mood, call the thing by another name.</p>

<p>It is certain that votes were thrown away on nominal
candidates, and some even were given for Mr.
Banks which belonged rightfully to Mr. Aiken. The
members who cast those votes not only failed to reflect
the sentiments of their constituencies, but in some
cases openly defied and misrepresented the will of the
voters to whom they owed their seats. Why these
men betrayed the Democratic party in the memorable
parliamentary battle which, as Mr. Blaine says “marked
an epoch,” will perhaps forever remain one of the
mysteries of the lobby of that eventful Thirty-fourth
Congress.</p>

<p>John Kelly, Howard Cobb and others strongly suspected
that corrupt appliances were at work.</p>

<p>Mr. Stephens, in a letter to his brother Linton Stephens,
February 1st, 1856, said: “But for a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faux pas</i>
on the part of that fool C——, I think we should have
made Aiken Speaker to-day. I had set the programme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
for it about ten days ago. My plan was this: after the
plurality rule should have been adopted (which I had
all along believed after a while would be), and two ballots
should have been had under it, if the Southern
Know-Nothings should not indicate a purpose to go
over to Orr to prevent Banks’s election (which I did
not much expect them to do), then Aiken was to be
put in nomination on the floor, Orr to decline, and let
the last vote be between Aiken and Banks. From my
knowledge of the House, its present tone and temper,
knowledge of Aiken and the estimation he was held
in by several of the scatterers, I believed he would beat
Banks. This I communicated to a few, and a few only.
I gave Cobb, of Georgia, my idea; he was struck with
it, and communicated it to a few others. It took finely.
I sounded some of the Western Know-Nothings,—Marshall
and others,—and found that they could be
brought into it. I said nothing of my plan, but simply
asked carelessly how Aiken would do. I found
that he would do for them. But after his name began
to be talked of, he got so popular in the minds of many
that C——, a fool, plugged the melon before it was
ripe. If we had then been under the pressure of the
plurality rule, and the choice between him and Banks,
he would have been elected, sure as fate, in my opinion.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>In conversations with the writer of this memoir,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and in letters to him on the subject, Mr. Stephens often
spoke of Mr. Kelly’s conduct during this first great
struggle between the Democratic and Republican parties
in the House of Representatives, as truly admirable
and patriotic. “Mr. Kelly,” said he, “never hounded
on anybody against the South, but was one of the few
Northern Democrats who then stood firmly by us, in
defense of our Constitutional rights against the assaults
of Republicans and Know-Nothings, who had formed
an unholy alliance against us.” The present writer
has sometimes read, with surprise, attacks on Mr. Kelly
in Southern newspapers of respectability and standing,
such as the Baltimore <cite>Sun</cite> and Atlanta <cite>Constitution</cite>,
which only could be ascribed to insufficient information
on the part of the writers, or perhaps they unintentionally
erred in accepting the scurrilous caricatures
of <em>Puck</em>, and other Gerrymanders, for the real John
Kelly.</p>

<p>Mr. Banks appointed the standing Committees of
the House in the interest of the ultra wing of the
Republican party, of which William H. Seward and
Joshua R. Giddings were the leaders. M. Seward
was at length at the head of a great organization, with
the immense power of the popular branch of Congress
at his back, and no other man in American politics
ever made more of his opportunities. Five years before
he had been rudely jostled from his dream of
ambition by the death of President Taylor, to whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
friendship for him he was indebted for his elevation to
leadership in the Whig party in 1849. That event
had been rendered possible in consequence of the disastrous
feuds in the Democratic party of New York
in 1848. While Hunkers and Barnburners fought,
the Whigs captured the Legislature of New York, by
which a Senator in Congress was to be chosen. Mr.
Seward was elected Senator. His political sagacity
soon enabled him to grasp the situation. Deeming it
certain that whoever might control the Administration
patronage, whether Senator or not, would control the
politics of New York, he went to Washington, and
paid assiduous court to that dashing Virginian, William
Ballard Preston, Secretary of the Navy, to whom
President Taylor was more attached than to any other
member of his Cabinet. As a charmer Mr. Seward
had few equals. He was addicted to aphorisms, and
studied <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mots</i> with the diligence of Sheridan. His
affectation of philosophy was set off by good manners
and easy address. He had been a school-master in
Georgia, and had at his command a fund of South-of-Potomac
reminiscences, saws, and anecdotes. In the
company of William Ballard Preston he was never so
happy as when expatiating over the types, and modes,
and fascinations of Southern society. The Tazewells,
Randolphs, Gastons, Lowndes, Calhouns, Crawfords,
Forsyths, Lumpkins, and other famous Cavaliers, were
all names familiar on Mr. Seward’s lips as household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
words. It did not take him long to win Preston, and
that gentleman soon addressed himself to the task of
winning over the President to the side of Mr. Seward.
But Vice-President Fillmore was Seward’s bitterest
enemy, and Taylor’s confidence was of slower growth
than Preston’s. Fierce sectional passions upon the subject
of slavery were already raging between the North
and South, and the old hero of Buena Vista desired to
allay those passions, and render his Administration the
era of pacification. Pledges were finally exacted and
given, James Watson Webb representing Mr. Seward,
and Secretary Preston representing the President, and
the patronage of the Administration in New York was
placed at Mr. Seward’s disposal; in consideration of
which that wily diplomat entered into engagements to
take no part in the Senate of the United States in the
Abolition agitation, but to pursue a policy of conciliation
and compromise at Washington. He had been
elected Senator to succeed a Democrat. Daniel Webster,
Henry Clay and John J. Crittenden, and the other
leading Whigs in the Senate and House, were friends
of Mr. Fillmore, and unalterably opposed to Seward’s
recognition by Taylor, upon any terms, as leader of
the Administration party in New York. Angry controversies
took place in Administration circles. A
breach occurred between the President and Vice-President,
and their social relations were broken off.
Preston had acquired complete personal ascendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
over Taylor, and the old soldier became a violent partisan
of Mr. Seward. The Senator from New York
was now recognized as the real leader of the Whig
party, and wielded the Administration lash with exasperating
indifference to the powerful men arrayed on
the side of Mr. Fillmore. Alienations took place between
life-long friends, and many of the great Whig
statesmen were not even on speaking terms. The
Whig party was rent in twain.</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine has recently discussed some of the political
events of this period of American history, in his
valuable work “Twenty Years of Congress,” but in
assigning causes for the destruction of the Whig party,
he has strangely overlooked this portentous quarrel,
provoked by Seward, which was the underlying cause,—the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa causans</i>,—of the dissolution and utter extinction
of that celebrated party.</p>

<p>On the 11th of March, 1850, Mr. Seward, unmindful
of his pledges to William Ballard Preston, made a
violent Abolition speech in the Senate. The Georgia
school-master has outwitted the Secretary of the Navy.
Charles Francis Adams, in his memorial address at
Albany on Mr. Seward, stated that he was aware of the
“agreement,” as he called it, between the Auburn
statesman and Taylor’s Administration, but he must
have been ignorant of its real terms, for a descendant
of two Presidents would scarcely have regarded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
violation of voluntary pledges as a fit topic for glowing
eulogy.</p>

<p>And now in that month of March, 1850, William
H. Seward was at the height of power. In all human
probability he would be next President of the United
States. Short-lived triumph. The summer of his
glory was soon overcast with stormy portents. Within
four little months Zachary Taylor lay dead in the
White House, and Fillmore, Seward’s dearest foe, was
President. The downfall of the Whig party soon followed,
and Mr. Seward and Winfield Scott sat amid
its ruins. It was about this time that Daniel Webster
said to his friend Peter Harvey of Boston: “One of
the convictions of my mind, and it is very strong, is
that the people of the United States will never entrust
their destinies, and the administration of their government,
to the hands of William H. Seward and his
associates.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>But Mr. Webster, perhaps, underestimated the character
of Mr. Seward. In 1856, upon the election of
Nathaniel P. Banks as Speaker of the House of Representatives,
the distinguished New York Senator
became titular primate of a new and more powerful
organization than the Whig party ever had been in its
palmiest days. England is governed by Cabinet Ministers
with seats in Parliament; the United States by
standing Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
by whom legislation is initiated, secretly
formulated, and then carried through both Houses by
aid of caucus management, and under the whip and
spur of imperious majorities. This vast energy Mr.
Seward now commanded through Speaker Banks in the
House of Representatives. He had admirable lieutenants.
Banks was a fair Speaker in his rulings, and not
a sticker over non-essentials, but in everything that seriously
affected the welfare of the Republican party, he
was an aggressive and tenacious partisan. The astute
Thurlow Weed was even a shrewder politician than
Mr. Seward himself; and Horace Greeley, adopting the
maxim of Daniel O’Connell—that agitation is the life of
every cause—employed his unrivaled editorial pen in the
anti-slavery crusade, now fairly inaugurated throughout
the Northern States. Yet with all his great advantages
and skill as an organizer, Mr. Seward could
not have carried the Republican party to victory, had
not some of the leaders of the Democratic party, during
the last five years of their ascendency at Washington,
wilfully neglected their opportunities, and given to
their more vigilant opponents the vantage ground in
the collision of forces on the floor of Congress.</p>

<p>During the latter days of the Pierce administration,
and the whole of that of Buchanan, measures of great
national importance were defeated through the culpable
negligence of a few Southern Democrats. Northern
Representatives who stood by the South in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
defense of its constitutional rights, bitterly complained
of this neglect on the part of those who were so deeply
interested. These Northern men, like Mr. Kelly and
Horace F. Clark, had to brave a false but growing
public opinion at the North, on account of their heroic
devotion to what they deemed the line of duty, especially
on the great Territorial questions, over which
the Union was being shaken to its foundations.
They had, therefore, the right to expect corresponding
earnestness on the part of all their fellow Democrats
of the South. To hold to Jeffersonian, strict construction
opinions was then becoming extremely unpopular
at the North, and involved sacrifices that threatened to
blight their political prospects. To maintain similar
opinions at the South was a wholly different matter.
Everybody there believed in the State-rights doctrine,
and public men were carried smoothly on with the
current in defending measures of administration.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly observed some things which he could not
but regard with pain during the Thirty-fourth and
Thirty-fifth Congresses, for they were pregnant with
ill-omens for the country, and to a man of his perspicacious
brain they must have foreboded those disasters
to the Democratic party which ere long overtook it.
There was an incapacity for affairs on the part of a few
Southern Representatives, and a proneness to intemperance
among quite a number of otherwise excellent
men from the same section. It was a bad symptom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
the distempered state of the Democratic party to find
many of its Representatives frequently, and inexcusably,
absent from their seats when test votes were about to
be taken, fraught with vital interest to the South, and
decisive of great national policies. The fault was more
grievous, when the absentees, as was often the case,
would have been able to change the result by being
present and voting. This was attributable in some measure
to inexperience, and want of training for public life.
Some there were who were addicted to pleasure parties,
frequently went home to their families, and entertained
fanciful ideas respecting the duties devolving on
gentlemen in society. That they were honorable men
who would not stoop to disreputable conduct, no one
who knew them can for a moment doubt. Indeed
their integrity bore refreshing contrast to the looser
morality so often to be encountered in a later political
generation. The trouble simply was that these men
were impracticables, and out of place in the Halls of
Congress during the stormy days of 1855-60. They
talked politics in the parlor and bar-room, and neglected
their duties in the House and Senate. John
Randolph, in his Hudibrastic vein, scores a similar class
that flourished in Virginia in 1831: “We hug our
lousy cloaks around us, take another <em>chaw of tubbacker</em>,
float the room with nastiness, or ruin the grate and
fire-irons, where they happen not to be rusty, and try
conclusions upon constitutional points.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>But a still greater evil was intemperance. The Hole-in-the-Wall,
in the House of Representatives, was the
downward path to irretrievable ruin, where many a
noble fellow of genius and promise drowned his faculties
in rum, when his country most needed his services.
While the Democrats and Republicans were in a
deadly struggle on the floor of the House over questions
involving the destinies of the Union, and the
lives and fortunes of millions of human beings, the
tipplers were in the bar-room drinking, or on the sofas
of the lobby dozing in their cups. A vote is wanting
to carry an imperiled measure to victory,—the inebriate
is lifted into a sitting posture, dragged to the
floor, and bid to vote aye, or no, provided he is there to
mumble out the word. Too often he is absent, having
been carried off to his lodgings in a state of drunken
imbecility. John Quincy Adams<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, in his Memoirs,
inveighs savagely against this melancholy vice, as the
besetting sin of an earlier day; and Alexander H.
Stephens, in his private letters to his brother, Judge
Linton Stephens, pours out indignant lamentations
over the same disgraceful spectacle at the period under
review.</p>

<p>“One vote against us,” writes Mr. Stephens to his
brother, August 23, 1856, on the loss of an important
bill. “Seven more Southern men absent than Northern.
If our men had stayed, we should have been
triumphant to-day. On several votes we lost two to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
three Southern men who were too drunk to be brought
in.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Again, February 5, 1858, he says: “I have
been more provoked at the course of Southern men on
this Kansas question from the beginning than upon
any other subject in my public career. I mean their
culpable negligence.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He informs his brother that
thirteen Southern Democrats were absent March 11,
1858, when an important vote was taken, and the
Republicans prevailed. “Had the thirteen been present
we should have saved the question. How shamefully
the South is represented! Some of the Southern
men were too drunk to be got into the House. * * Have
we any future but miserable petty squabbles, parties,
factions, and fragments of organizations, led on by
contemptible drunken demagogues?”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The next day he writes again: “As usual we lost
the question by the absence of two Southern votes.
Luck seems to be against us. We had all our other
men there to-day except those paired. Some were so
drunk they had to be kept out until they were wanted
to say ‘aye,’ or ‘no,’ as the case might be.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Two
years later, after the celebrated Charleston Democratic
National Convention had broken up in a row, and
the Douglas wing had adjourned to meet in Baltimore,
and the Breckenridge wing in Richmond, Mr. Stephens
seems to hint that drunkenness had something to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
with that most fatal step the Democrats ever took. “I
am sorry,” he says in a letter to Professor Johnston,
“things are as they are; sorry as I should be to see
the paroxyms of a dear friend in a fit of delirium
tremens.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Mr. Kelly, who was a delegate to
the Charleston Convention, returned home mortified
and sad. “The drunkenness down there,” said he to
the author of this memoir, “was shameful. Men whose
minds are inflamed with whiskey are not able to govern
themselves, much less the country. Alas! for the poor
Democratic party. The disruption means defeat, and
unless the Douglas men and Anti-Douglas men come
together and nominate a single ticket, the Republicans
will carry the election.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly, during his two terms in Congress, witnessed
the demoralizing scenes to which Mr. Stephens
refers in his letters. Kelly was often amused in spite
of himself when he went out to the lobby to shake up
some poor inebriated gentleman, and lead him to the
floor to give an important vote. The grotesqueness
and difficulties of the task, and the absurd figure cut
by the tipsy Solon, always excited his risibilities,
although he tried to keep a straight face during the trip
to and fro. His account of some of these scenes, never
mentioned except among intimate friends, was rich in
comic touches and facial contortions. His mimicry of
the scenes was irresistible. But he, too, equally with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Mr. Stephens, saw what it would all lead to, and felt
that the Democratic party was in a bad way.</p>

<p>Another element of Democratic weakness was the
over-readiness of those called Fire-eaters to appeal to
the code duello, or other forms of personal rencontre.
This was made by an unfriendly press to bear the appearance
of a species of terrorism, and was to some
extent a revival of the bullying and domineering so
common among the Federalists in Congress in their
treatment of Democrats during the Administration of
John Adams. Writing in 1809 of “the brow-beatings
and insults,” to which the Federalists subjected the
Democrats in the days of the elder Adams, Mr. Jefferson
says: “No person who was not a witness of the
scenes of that gloomy period can form any idea of the
afflicting persecutions and personal indignities we had
to brook. They saved our country, however.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The
inexcusable assault of Preston S. Brooks on Charles
Sumner in the Senate Chamber, May 22, 1856, had
had its exact counterpart on the floor of the House of
Representatives, February 15, 1798, when Roger Griswold,
a member of Congress from Connecticut, with a
stout hickory club, made a furious assault during the
sitting of the House upon the celebrated Matthew
Lyon, one of the Representatives from Vermont.
Griswold was a Federalist, and Lyon a Democrat. But
in the latter case the assault was made by Brooks, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
Democrat, upon Sumner, a Republican. The Federalists
condoned the offense of Griswold, and by the
decisive majority of 73 to 21 refused to expel him from
Congress. Even a resolution to censure him was lost.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
The Republicans of 1856, political legatees of the
Federalists of 1798, did not show the same forbearance
in the case of Brooks. A resolution of expulsions received
121 affirmative, and 94 negative votes in the
House, not enough to expel a member under the two-thirds
rule required by the Constitution, but more than
enough, remembering the palliation of Griswold’s
offense, to prove that all such votes reflect the partisan
prejudices rather than the impartial judgment of
members.</p>

<p>In 1856 a scuffle took place upon the floor of Congress
between Mr. John Sherman of Ohio, and Mr.
Wright of Tennessee. Mr. Sherman attempted to
throw a handful of wafers in Mr. Wright’s face, and
the latter returned the compliment by aiming a blow
at Sherman with his fist. The latter put his hand in
his pistol-pocket, but before he could draw members
rushed between the combatants, and separated them.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Intense excitement prevailed during this bear-garden
performance.</p>

<p>A still more disgraceful scene occurred in the House,
February 5, 1858. Mr. Grow of Pennsylvania, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Mr. Keitt of South Carolina became engaged in a
regular fist fight, which spread to others until the
flourishing conflict boasted not less than thirty active
participants. The fight took place directly in front of
the Clerk’s desk. In the midst of the melee Mr.
Barksdale, who afterwards fell in the battle of Gettysburgh,
rushed at Mr. Covode of Pennsylvania, who
had lifted up a heavy spittoon and was about to hurl
it at the head of the Mississippian, but at that instant
some one seized Barksdale by the head, and off came
his wig, leaving his shining pate glittering in the gas
light, perfectly bald. At this ludicrous vision the enraged
combatants and all the spectators were moved to
laughter, and finally Mr. Speaker was able, by aid of
the Sergeant-at-Arms, who bore his mace on high and
led his posse through the throng, to recall the House,
if not to order, at least from pandemonium.</p>

<p>“Last night,” says Mr. Stephens, in a letter,
February 5, 1858, “we had a battle royal in the House.
Thirty men at least were engaged in the fisticuff.
Fortunately, no weapons were used. It was the first
sectional fight ever had on the floor, I think; and if
any weapons had been on hand it would probably have
been a bloody one. All things here are tending to
bring my mind to the conclusion that the Union cannot,
or will not last long.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kelly in the midst of these belligerent and disgraceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
scenes kept cool and calm. Once, however,
Mr. Humphrey Marshall, the Kentucky Know-Nothing,
provoked him into momentary indignation by an insulting
allusion to Mr. Kelly’s religion, and by charging
Catholics with abject servitude in all civil and religious
matters to the will of a foreign prince, the Pope
of Rome. Kelly rose and corrected Marshall without
discourtesy or bad feeling, but the huge form of the
Kentuckian dilated with rage, and he repeated the
offensive charge in still stronger language. Then
Kelly rose with fire in his eye, and hurled back the
charge in such manner as to satisfy the whole House,
and Marshall in particular, that the barbaric passion
for war, however held in subjection at other times,
now glowed in the bosom of the New York member
with irresistible fierceness. The two gentleman sat
near each other, and the scene as described to the author
of this memoir by a member who occupied an
intervening seat, Judge Augustus R. Wright of Georgia,
must have produced intense excitement throughout
the House. Judge Wright, a distinguished
Southern lawyer, said that after the colloquy between
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Marshall, which is imperfectly reported
in the Globe, and after Mr. Marshall had concluded
his speech, the latter walked over to Mr. Kelly’s
seat, and demanded to know what he meant by declaring
the statement he had made was false. Marshall
was known to be a believer in the code duello, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
was a man of immense size. Mr. Kelly kept his eyes
fixed on Mr. Marshall as he approached, and Mr.
Wright said that his physiognomy would have been a
study for Lavater. It was rigid and intent, but the
eyes kindled with peculiar light, and he gave Marshall
such a glance that he, Wright, never could forget it as
long as he lived, and he supposed Marshall never would
either. To the question Kelly replied: “I meant
exactly what I said; your statement was not true, Sir.”
Mr. Kelly was on his feet facing Mr. Marshall, and
Judge Wright anticipated an immediate collision between
them. It was avoided, however, and Marshall,
with returning good humor, made some allusion to the
plain modes of speech in vogue among New York
members, and went back to his place.—The colloquy
as published in the Globe, toned down considerably in
asperity, is as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall. “I feel quite sure there should
have been a distinction drawn between the Papist
and the Catholic. I understand that a portion of
the Catholics hold the doctrine that the Pope,—whether
it springs from his spiritual power or his
temporal power, or both combined, is in the last
resort the ultimate judge, not only of moral right,
but under the moral law, of political right; and,
therefore, possesses the power in some way, to absolve
the citizen from obedience to the law of the land
or country to which he belongs, of which his Holiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
may disapprove as an infraction of the Divine
law.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly. “I desire to ask the gentleman a question.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall. “The gentleman can take an hour
to reply to my speech.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly. “The gentleman asserts what is not a
fact, and I desire”—</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall. “I have found a great contrariety
of opinions among Catholics upon this particular
branch of my subject, and I do not expect that my
friend from New York and I shall agree upon what
are the facts in regard to it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly. “I deny that they hold any such doctrine,
and the gentleman states what is not true.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall. “Well, I must say that the gentleman
puts his remarks in a very blunt form.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly. “I say that the statement is not
true.”</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall. “Why surely one branch of the
Church holds that doctrine.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly. “I say there is no branch in this country
that holds that doctrine; and the gentleman has
never seen one that advocates that doctrine.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Marshall reiterated the statement, and Mr.
Kelly in still more positive language denounced it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
untrue, and challenged the Kentuckian to produce any
evidence to sustain his allegation. The scene was becoming
very animated, and as the two herculean Representatives
glared at each other with angry mien and
menacing front, Mr. Wright was reminded, as he afterwards
said, of Milton’s picture:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">“Such a frown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each cast at the other, as when two black clouds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With heaven’s artillery fraught, come rattling on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Over the Caspian, then stand front to front</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To join their dark encounter in mid-air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So frowned the mighty combatants.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this dispute with Marshall was a very exceptional
thing to happen to Mr. Kelly. He was a universal
favorite in both Houses of Congress, and his
popularity continued to grow the longer he remained
at the Federal Capital. Some rare men there are in
this world in whom there is such unity of character,
whose talents however high are equalled by the qualities
of their hearts; whose virtues however great are
equalled by the warmth of their affections and the
sweetness of their temper; they carry a passport to
the common heart written, as it were, upon their fronts
by the finger of God. “The world is a looking-glass,”
says Thackeray in Vanity Fair, “and gives
back to every man the reflection of his own face.
Frown at it, and it will in turn look sourly upon you;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
laugh at it and with it, and it is a jolly kind companion.”
Sir Thomas More was one of those rare
characters who won the general heart by the sunshine
that played about him. He met Erasmus at a dinner
table in London without an introduction, but Erasmus
knew him at once. “Aut Morus aut Nullus,” said he.
“Aut Erasmus aut Diabolus,” was the waggish reply.
In America occasionally some noble spirit appears who
finds his way to all hearts without an effort. Such a
man was Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina, simple,
plain, unostentatious, the political idol of John
Randolph, “the last of the Romans” as Jefferson
called him; “a speaker,” says Benton, “of no pretension
and great performance, who spoke more good
sense while he was getting up out of his chair and
getting back into it, than many others did in long
discourses.”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Mr. Stephens frequently said to the
present writer that John Kelly reminded him more
of Nathaniel Macon than did any other man in public
life. Kelly’s rugged sense of right, his blunt honesty,
sagaciousness, modesty, and good humor, conspired to
make friends for him on all sides of the House. If
he was asked to do a favor for any one, he generally
did more than was asked, and never said anything
about it afterwards. Kindness and service to mankind
were virtues of which he was the cheerful exemplar.</p>

<p>Stephens and Kelly were strikingly alike in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
respect, both seemed never to tire in well-doing and
deeds of benevolence. The number of poor boys who
have owed their education and success in life to these
two men has been very large. There are hundreds of
happy homes in this country to-day where poverty
has been turned into comfort, and pinching want into
comparative prosperity, by Alexander H. Stephens
and John Kelly. The two gentlemen were deeply
attached friends, and each regarded the other as the
type of an honest statesman. Twenty years after the
close of their Congressional relations, Mr. Stephens,
in a letter to the present writer, desired to be remembered
to Mr. Kelly in the kindest manner. The following
is the letter, personal matters of no interest to
the general reader being omitted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">

<p>I am now just about leaving home for an absence of several
days. I want you to read Johnston and Browne’s recent book. I
have ordered several copies, but none has yet reached here, or
I would send you one. Give John Kelly my kindest regards when
you see him. I regard him as one of the ablest and truest men in
this country. * * *</p>

<p>With best wishes to you and all yours, I remain,</p>

<p class="center no-indent">

<span class="smcap">Alexander H. Stephens</span>.<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Kelly’s esteem for Mr. Stephens while living,
and his respect for the great Commoner’s memory
when dead, are shown by the subjoined extract from
an article which appeared in the New York Utica
Observer, November 22, 1884:</p>

<p>“William M. Evarts, Republican, and John Kelly,
Democrat, have each contributed fifty dollars to the
Alexander H. Stephens Memorial Fund. John Kelly
wrote as follows to the Committee: ‘I had the honor
of sitting in Congress with this gentleman thirty years
ago, and always entertained for him the highest regard.
He was a noble example of a statesman; in
fact, I never met a man who was so pure in his intentions
in public life.’ Commenting upon this circumstance,
the Atlanta <cite>Constitution</cite> says: ‘It is a good
sign of the proper feeling between the South and North
to see such men as W.M. Evarts and John Kelly joining
in doing honor to the memory of the ex-Vice-President
of the Confederacy.’”</p>

</div>


<p>As a comprehensive portrayal, rather than biography
in detail, is the design of this volume, a general
survey of Mr. Kelly’s Congressional career is all that
can be attempted in these pages, with concise mention
of some of its leading events and incidents. His
speeches alone would fill a book of equal size to this.</p>

<p>In the course of a debate in the Committee of the
whole on the State of the Union, May 26, 1856, Mr.
Kelly delivered a strong speech upon New York politics,
in which he gave an interesting review of the
divisions that had prevailed in the Democratic party
of that State. Tracing back those divisions to 1848,
he gave a lucid insight into the history of the Hunkers
and Barnburners, and of the later factions known as
Hard Shells and Soft Shells. He evinced thorough
acquaintance with the complexional differences between
those factions, and with the political history of the
Empire State, a knowledge which was to prove so useful
to him in after years. He charged that many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
the Hards were Know-Nothings, but attributed patriotic
motives to other members of that wing of the party.
He might have made the same charge of Know-Nothingism
with equal justice against many of the Softs.
Subsequent history probably has led Mr. Kelly to
modify some of the opinions he expressed in that
speech. There were good National Democrats in both
wings of the party, the disturbing question of slavery
being the chief cause of dissension. The anti-slavery
agitation at the North, and consequent dissemination
at the South of the old New England doctrine of secession,
were the two growing ideas, the monomania of
that age of American history. The Republican party
was more largely recruited from the ranks of the Soft
Shells than from those of the Hard Shells, and the
resolutions and speeches in the Syracuse Soft Convention
of 1855, of which Mr. Kelly was a member, and
which were discussed at large in a former chapter,
clearly indicated that such would be the case.</p>

<p>As sound a Democrat as President Pierce was,
he made the mistake of placing the chief control of
his Administration in the hands of those Democrats,
both at the North and South, who had opposed the
compromise of 1850, such as John A. Dix and John
Van Buren on the one hand, and Jefferson Davis on
the other.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding,” said Mr. Kelly, “the outcry
raised by our enemies, who desire to destroy the influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
of New York, let me assure you, Mr. Chairman,
that there now exists no division among the Democratic
masses there. They now happily constitute a
united party, bound together by a common creed and
a common interest. This union of the Hunker and
Barnburner sections of the party was accomplished in
1849, the year after the unfortunate defeat of General
Cass, and it has gone on strengthening ever since, in
spite of the transient fanaticisms of Republicanism
and Know-Nothingism, from one or the other of which
the party in every section of the country has suffered
temporary damage, our late reverses in New York
forming no exception to the general rule. If the
Democrats of Louisiana, or Tennessee, or of any other
Southern States, have been prostrated when opposed
to only one of these evils, is it a peculiar disgrace—is
it any special evidence of impotency, that we have
had to yield once or twice before the combined forces
of both?”</p>

<p>During the year 1855 the crops in Europe and other
parts of the world suffered greatly from unseasonable
and excessive rains. In some places, particularly in
the Cape de Verde Islands, the wet weather was succeeded
by a protracted drought. For two years prior
to that year the Cape de Verdes had suffered from a
scarcity of food owing to similar causes, and a third
visitation now reduced the inhabitants in many places
to a state of starvation. The Bishop of those islands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
on the 12th of March, 1856, wrote an earnest appeal
for succor to Archbishop Hughes, of New York.
“Having exhausted all our own means,” said he, “it
only remains for us to appeal to the charity of the
public. If these people are not promptly succored
more than twenty thousand persons will perish, victims
of famine.” A movement was organized in New
York to send food to the famine-stricken islanders,
and a resolution was introduced in Congress by Mr.
Wheeler, of New York, in which the President was
requested to instruct the Secretary of the Navy to
detail twenty-five seamen to man the vessel in which
the cargo of food was to be shipped to the sufferers.
Archbishop Hughes had confided Bishop Patricio’s
appeal to Mr. Kelly, and requested him to lay it before
Congress, and use his best offices with his fellow-members
to secure favorable action upon it. On the
19th of May, Mr. Kelly asked and obtained the unanimous
consent of the House, after the introduction of
Mr. Wheeler’s resolution, to have the letter to Archbishop
Hughes read. The picture which the Bishop of
the Cape de Verde Islands had drawn of the dreadful
scourge deeply impressed members. In the course
of the debate some objections were made to the passage
of the resolution, to which Mr. Kelly replied as
follows:</p>

<p>“This resolution, Mr. Speaker, merely proposes to
relieve the poor people in those islands, who are now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
in a state of starvation on account of the blight to
their vine crop; and it is astonishing to me that any
member of this House should object to a resolution of
this kind. It asks no appropriation of money; it does
not ask Congress to appropriate a single dollar towards
relieving them. The generous citizens of New York
have come forward and held a meeting at the Exchange
in that city, and agreed to load a vessel with provisions
for the use of these destitute people of the
Cape de Verdes, who are now living on the bark of
trees, the stalks of bananas, and anything else they
can pick up to save themselves from utter starvation.
Therefore, I trust that there will be no objection from
any gentleman in this House to the resolution presented
by my colleague. It merely asks that a crew of
United States seamen may be given to navigate the
vessel, in order that relief may reach those poor people
in time to save them from impending destruction.
It is not much that is asked, and we ought, I think,
cheerfully to grant it.”</p>

<p>This simple, strong appeal proved effective, and the
resolution was passed by the large vote of 123 ayes
to 24 noes.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly was again nominated for Congress in
1856, and at the election on November 4th of that
year was returned to the Thirty-fifth Congress by an
overwhelming majority. Of the 11,599 votes cast in
the Fourth Congressional District of New York, John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Kelly received 8,319, L. W. Ryckman, 1,497; W. F.
Gould, 1,735, and 48 were scattering. Kelly’s majority
over all was 5,039.</p>

<p>During Mr. Kelly’s second term in Congress a savage
riot occurred in Washington at the District election
in June, 1857. For some time the city was at
the mercy of a gang of professional desperadoes, composed
of Washington Know-Nothings, and Plug
Uglies of the same party from Baltimore, the latter
being the pets and followers of the malignant Henry
Winter Davis. The Mayor was powerless to preserve
the peace with the insufficient police force at his command,
and President Buchanan, on the Mayor’s requisition,
called out the Marines at the Navy Yard under
Major Tyler to disperse the rioters. The military proceeded
to the Northern Liberties, where they were
attacked by the mob, and several innocent citizens
were killed. Major Tyler was finally compelled to return
the fire of the infuriated mob, and for some time
that portion of the city was the scene of a fierce battle.
It was not until the fire of the soldiers was directed
in a few cases with fatal effect that the miscreants
were driven off and dispersed.</p>

<p>After the disturbance, the Mayor of the city and
the Chief of the Washington police, feeling themselves
unable to cope with the lawless bands in their midst,
appealed to Congress for relief. A bill to establish
an Auxiliary Guard for the protection of public and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
private property in the city of Washington was accordingly
introduced in the Senate, and after an extended
debate the excellent measure passed that body,
and was sent to the House of Representatives for action
there. The remedies applied in the city of Baltimore,
where still more atrocious scenes of bloodshed
annually had occurred under Mayor Swan’s Know-Nothing
administration, with Henry Winter Davis
firing the hearts of his Plug Uglies to a war of extermination
against foreigners, presented an example to
Washington of the effective way of redeeming the latter
city from the scoundrels who infested it. The Legislature
of Maryland took the control of the police
force of Baltimore from the Mayor, and lodged it in
the hands of an independent officer known as Marshal
of Police. In the bill creating the office the celebrated
George P. Kane was designated as Marshal,
and no better man ever lived for a position of that kind.
Col. Kane was a gentleman by instinct and education;
the purity of his character was universally recognized,
and the intrepidity of his nature was perfectly understood
by the law-breakers of Baltimore. A man of
gigantic stature, he possessed wonderful symmetry and
comeliness of person, enormous physical strength, and
a courage that would have carried him to the stake to
be flayed alive in vindication of an idea or principle
he believed to be right. This man did more to redeem
Baltimore from the assassins and ruffians who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
had controlled it than all other men and agencies combined.
Under Marshal Kane’s magnificent administration
the Monumental City became one of the most
peaceable, as it long had been one of the most beautiful
of American cities. In after years the people rewarded
this destroyer of Know-Nothingism in their
midst, first with the office of High Sheriff, and next
with that of Mayor of Baltimore.</p>

<p>The bill to establish an Auxiliary Guard in
Washington, whose features resembled those of the
Maryland Act creating a Marshal of Police in the
city of Baltimore, received Mr. Kelly’s decided approval
and support when it reached the House. In
the course of the debate on this bill, April 15, 1858,
Mr. Kelly said:</p>

<p>“The proposition before the Committee is that the
police laws of this city are of such a character that
the citizens of Washington have to ask Congress to
alter them in order to protect them from the murderer
and assassin. The bill proposes to give to the
President of the United States the power to appoint
the Chief of Police, and that that Chief of Police, with
the consent of the Secretary of the Interior, shall have
the power to appoint his subordinate officers. The
people here are willing to throw up their charter,
given to them by Congress, for the reason, as they say,
that they are not able to protect themselves against
the criminals that infest the city. The amendment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
proposed by the gentleman from New York (Mr.
Dodd) providing for the selection of Commissioners
by the people is, in my opinion, objectionable. Men
elected as Americans will, of course, appoint Americans
or Know-Nothings to office, and <em>vice versa</em>, Democrats
will do the same thing. The only way to give
this city an efficient police is by passing the bill reported
by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goode),
placing the power in the hands of the President of
the United States to appoint the Chief of Police.
Mr. Chairman, in the various arguments that have
been made on this bill, all kinds of logic have been
brought to bear in favor of gentlemen’s different prejudices.
The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Maynard),
in discussing this bill yesterday, referred to a
transaction which took place during a former Congress.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
He spoke of men who earn their living by
the sweat of their brow as a ‘parcel of Irish waiters.’
Now, sir, I do not think that that expression was
called for. These men, whether Irish or German, or
belonging to any other country, have the same rights
under the Constitution as American-born citizens. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
is not to be said that because these men were waiters,
they had not their independent rights and privileges as
much as the Representatives of the people on this
floor. I tell the gentleman from Tennessee, and other
members of this House, that the humble Irishman
has his rights under the Constitution, naturalized as
he is by your laws, equally with the native-born, and
until he commits some act in derogation of the true
principles of manhood, it does not become any gentleman
to stigmatize him or speak of him in such a contemptuous
style.</p>

<p>“The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stanton), in
speaking on this Bill, attributes the defeat in 1844 of
that great and honored statesman, Mr. Clay, who has
long since gone to his grave, to the Empire Club in
the city of New York, and to the manner in which
the election was conducted in that city. Let me tell
the gentleman that I was conversant with all those
facts, and knew of the transactions which took place
in New York in 1844. There was another Club there
at that time, and it was a very objectionable one, because
all the pugilists, all the fighters, and all the rowdies
you could find, were brought together by pay, by
solicitations of whatever nature, and were formed into
a Club in opposition to the Empire Club at that time.
Now, I ask the gentleman if he knows who was president
of that Club?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Stanton: “I know nothing in regard to that
Club. Who was the man?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “Bill Poole. I am sorry to say he got
into a personal difficulty in New York and was killed.
Let me say to the gentleman that when both of those
Clubs were organized at that particular time, though
there were violent men in both, neither one of these
Clubs used violence against citizens in going to the
polls to exercise the right of suffrage. That cannot
be said in this city, for I am reminded of the transactions
which took place at the election here last June.”</p>

<p>“The gentleman from Mississippi, (Mr. Quitman,)
said, in his speech, that there was no violence in this
city; that he had travelled around on frequent occasions,
in order to see if some one of the rowdies here
would not attack him. Now I know that the gentleman
has displayed courage upon the battle-field, and
rendered essential service to his country. No man
doubts his integrity, his honesty and his bravery; but
had he been here last June, he would have met in the
streets of this city that which no man desires to meet.
I saw a body of young men from eighteen to twenty
years of age, driving men of thirty and forty years of
age before them like sheep from the field, and firing
their pistols among them indiscriminately. Yet there
did not appear to be, so far as I could see, courage
enough in the citizens of this city to resent the outrage
which was perpetrated upon them at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>“Crime, Mr. Chairman, in all cities, whether it be
here, or in New York, or elsewhere, unless checked
by the physical power of man, will continually manifest
itself. Some gentlemen here have argued that
you cannot check it by physical force; that moral
force must be resorted to. That is all humbug, for
such a check amounts to nothing at all. Violence of
all description will be committed, unless you have
proper officers to prevent it. Then you ought in the
present case to organize a police force to meet this exigency,
and to arrest the individuals who are in the
habit of committing crimes in your city. Now this
bill organizes an efficient police, under the jurisdiction
of officers of this Government who have the full
control of it,—a force which will be the means of protecting
individuals who come here to transact business,
as well as yourselves, for many of you admit that it is
dangerous to leave your rooms at night,—that you are
afraid of encountering these marauders who infest the
city. The main objection on the other side of the
House is that the Chief of Police, who may be appointed
by the President, will be partial in his appointments,
selecting only partisans, or those who favor his
political principles, just as it is supposed the President
himself will appoint a man who is of his politics.
That argument, in my opinion, cannot hold good. I
do not think such a course will be carried out, and I
know if I had anything to do with it, I would not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
partial at all. I would select men for their character
alone. If I saw they were efficient, physically able to do
the duties of policemen, and of good moral character,
I would appoint them upon such grounds alone, without
regard to politics. But, gentlemen on the other
side say they are afraid to trust the President. Well,
we are afraid to trust them in the city of New York.
The case of this city and that of New York, between
which some analogies have been made, are not parallel
cases at all. This city is under the jurisdiction of the
Federal Government. The President and the Congress
of the United States are here; Ministers from
foreign Governments are here; and the courts
here are under the jurisdiction of the Federal
Government. The only difference between the
appointment of a Chief of Police by the President
and by the Mayor is this: in the former case the
Chief of Police is responsible to the Federal Government,
and if he does not carry out the laws, can
easily be reached; while on the other hand if the
Mayor does not appoint satisfactorily, the people cannot
reach his appointee, in the same manner.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The Republicans and Know-Nothings were strong
enough, with the aid of a few Democrats, who had
fine-spun constitutional objections to it, to prevent
the passage of this excellent bill by the House, but
Mr. Kelly’s argument was not successfully answered
by any of the opponents of the measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>An interesting debate took place in the House,
May 3, 1858, in relation to the Bureau of Statistics
of the State Department, in which Mr. Kelly took a
prominent part. This Bureau was established by
Congress upon the recommendation of Mr. Marcy
during the last Administration. The urgent necessity
for such a Bureau was originally pointed out by Mr.
Webster in 1842, when he was at the head of the
Department. Several volumes upon the Commercial
Relations of the United States with all other countries
were issued during 1856 and 1857, prepared
ostensibly by Edmund Flagg, Superintendent of the
Bureau, but in reality Flagg had very little to do with
the work. Hugh C. McLaughlin of Virginia, Mr.
Flagg’s assistant, and who was soon after appointed
his successor as Superintendent, was the real compiler,
translator and editor of the valuable materials contained
in those volumes. But Flagg was Superintendent,
and he not only contrived to get his name
printed on the title page as such, but to monopolise
the whole credit to himself for the work. The volumes
were received with remarkable favor by the
leading commercial authorities in this country and
Europe. Hunt’s Merchants Magazine spoke highly
of them. In a notice of the fourth volume, the
London Athenæum of February 20, 1858, said: “The
highest praise is due to the House of Representatives
for publishing this comprehensive and really national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
report, which brings into one view the commercial
status of the United States with the entire world.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
The celebrated M. Rouher, then Minister of Agriculture
and Commerce in France, who subsequently
figured so conspicuously under the Empire of Napoleon
the Third, expressed unqualified praise of this work
of the State Department at Washington. To a friend
who sent him one of the volumes, M. Rouher wrote:
“This document is executed under the direction of
the Secretary of State, by Mr. Edmund Flagg, an
officer of the State Department. The Minister of
France at Washington had already communicated to
the Imperial Government the remarkable Report of
Mr. Flagg to Mr. Marcy. It contains abundant and
useful information; and I am happy to recognize in it
marked improvement over works of the same character
previously published by the American Government.
A further improvement will be accomplished
when, in accordance with the wish of Mr. Flagg,
Congress shall prescribe a continuous, periodical and
practically useful publication, like that which my
Department has constantly issued for many years.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>If M. Rouher was in the habit of following the
proceedings of the American Congress, his surprise
must have been great to find this same Mr. Flagg,
who but a few months before had expressed so earnest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
a desire for the continued and regular publication of
the Commercial Relations by the State Department,
now haunting the lobbies of Congress, and supplying
specious arguments to the opposition or Republican
members against the further publication of the work,
and in favor of the abolition of the Bureau itself.
That which he proclaimed a work of national importance
yesterday, he declared to be a useless encumbrance
to-day. Flagg’s sudden change of mind was
easily explained. Certain irregularities in his accounts
had been discovered, and Secretary Cass had compelled
him to send in his resignation. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hinc illae
lachrymæ.</i> The opposition members were always
ready to attack the Administration, and Mr. Flagg
plied them with frivolous arguments against the Bureau
from which he had been discharged. Mr. Nichols of
Ohio, and Mr. Washburne of Illinois, two Republican
Congressmen, perhaps unaware that Flagg was a man
with a grievance, espoused his cause, and while the
Appropriation Bill for the legislative, executive and
judicial branches of the Government was under consideration,
May 3, 1858, they declared that it would
be a waste of money to make any appropriation for
the Bureau of Statistics in the State Department, and
Mr. Nichols made this a pretext to denounce the extravagance
of the Administration. After he had made
his attack, and elicited no reply, Mr. Nichols was emboldened
to go farther, and indiscreetly began to cross-question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
the members of the Committee of Ways and
Means, of which Mr. Kelly was one, and by which
the Appropriation Bill had been brought in, and to
extol Flagg as a disinterested patriot, who had resigned
his office, because he could not conscientiously
draw a salary for work that was wholly useless. This
was a fatal line of attack for Nichols to pursue, as he
soon discovered to his cost. Senator Clay of Alabama,
Chairman of the Committee on Commerce in the Senate,
had investigated Flagg’s case in the State Department,
and Mr. Kelly afterwards had become acquainted
with the doings of the latter individual.
Challenged to defend the appropriation, Mr. J. Glancy
Jones, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means, and Mr. Kelly, a member of the same Committee,
completely turned the tables upon Mr. Nichols
and Mr. Washburne and after Kelly’s crushing
rejoinder, Mr. Nichols, the would-be-champion of
Flagg, dropped him as he would have run away from
the contagion, and made a most ludicrous retreat from
the field of his own selection.</p>

<p>To quote Mr. J. Glancy Jones, in his able defense
of this item of the Appropriation Bill brought in by
his Committee, would occupy too much space here;
but the spicy debate between Messrs. Nichols, Kelly,
and Washburne cannot be entirely omitted in a memoir
of Mr. Kelly’s life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Nichols: “I cannot take my seat without paying
a just tribute to the late Mr. Marcy, and Mr.
Flagg, who had charge of the preparation of the
volume known as the ‘Commercial Relations.’ I
would enquire of the gentleman (Mr. J. Glancy Jones)
whether the former Superintendent did not resign his
office under the express declaration that a discharge
of the duties of the office was no longer necessary;
and whether after that, and during this year, a successor
was appointed?”</p>

<p>Mr. J. Glancy Jones: “I do not know what induced
the gentleman alluded to to resign the office.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I have made some enquiry on this
subject, and from the best information I could get,
I learned that Mr. Flagg was compelled to resign because
there were charges made against him, to the
effect that he had employed women ostensibly at four
dollars a day, and only paid them at two dollars a day,
requiring their receipts for four dollars a day. This
fact was ascertained by the gentleman who represents
the Committee on Commerce of the Senate. When
he found that such was the case, he went to the State
Department and said, that if Mr. Flagg was not turned
out of that office, he would expose the matter to the
country. This was the reason that Mr. Flagg was
compelled to resign. So far as the Bureau itself is
concerned, every gentleman knows that there is no
Bureau in the Government that has been so effective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
in giving the country valuable statistical information.
But Mr. Flagg being compelled to resign, now comes
to Congress, and makes the effort to abolish a Bureau
which has been of so much benefit to the country.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nichols: “I beg leave to say that so far as my
action here is concerned, Mr. Flagg has nothing to do
with it whatever. He has been connected with that
Bureau, but I have spoken to him hardly half a dozen
times.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nichols, but a few minutes before, had been
extolling Flagg, and coupled his name with that of
Secretary Marcy in what he called a “just tribute.”
Now he wriggles out of the debate in the following
amusing style:</p>

<p>Mr. Nichols: “I desire to conclude what I have to
say. I wish the gentleman from New York to understand
that, in reference to anything he may say about
troubles in the Democratic camp which may have led
to the removal of any of its children, I desire to enter
into no discussion. I have nothing to do with it,
then, or the difficulties of this happy family.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I think the gentleman from Ohio is
entirely in error. The duty of the statisticians in the
State Department is to collate and compile all the
reports made by consuls at foreign ports upon commercial
matters, and everything which pertains to the
welfare and benefit of this Government. It is done
not only for the benefit of commercial men, but for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
the benefit of the community generally, and I think
the abolition of that particular branch of the Government
would be entirely wrong. The whole expense
of keeping it up amounts to very little. I say again
that the whole of this matter originated—though I do
not attribute it to the gentleman from Ohio—on the
part of disappointed gentlemen who had been turned
out of office, and in nothing else.”</p>

<p>Mr. Washburne, of Illinois: “My object in asking
my friend to yield me the floor is to say a word here
in reference to Mr. Flagg. I have had some acquaintance
with that gentleman from my connection with
this matter during the last Congress, and I am astonished
at the charges the gentleman from New York
has made here to-day; and I think it is due to Mr.
Flagg that the gentleman from New York should
state his authority. Those charges go to the country,
and reflect severely upon Mr. Flagg.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I have made no charge, and shall
make no charge against the gentleman.”</p>

<p>Mr. Washburne “Will the gentleman state his
authority for what he has said?”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “The State Department itself. If the
gentleman desires to have this matter investigated, let
him introduce a resolution for that purpose. If information
on the subject be desired for the House and
the country, let a resolution be introduced and passed
calling on the State Department to furnish it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Maynard: “I should like to know who is the
present head of the Bureau?”</p>

<p>Mr. Nichols: “These interruptions have entirely
broken the thread of my remarks. With the discussion
of family differences and difficulties which have
led to the removal of one man and the substitution of
another, I have nothing to do, and I desire to have
nothing to do with them. I do not know who fills
this office. It is nothing to me who does. I find I
have occupied about enough of the time of the Committee
with this question.”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The Bureau of Statistics flourished on, and was no
longer disturbed by Edmund Flagg. Mr. Kelly had
overwhelmingly refuted the charges of Messrs. Nichols
and Washburne against the management of the State
Department under General Cass.</p>

<p>There was a warm controversy between the Senate
and House of Representatives over the appropriations
for the naval service for the year ending June 30,
1859. Committees of Conference on the disagreeing
votes of the two Houses were appointed, and held
frequent meetings. The managers on the part of the
Senate were Stephen R. Mallory, Solomon Foot, and
Judah P. Benjamin; those on the part of the House
were Thomas S. Bocock, John Kelly and F. H. Morse.
The conferees finally agreed upon their report. Mr.
Bocock submitted the report to the House, June 11,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
1858. Of the few amendments in controversy, the
House Committee receded from their disagreement to
the second and third amendments, relating to an appropriation
of fifty thousand six hundred dollars for
a new purchase in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Messrs.
Morgan, Grow, Clemens and others energetically
opposed this appropriation. Mr. Bocock and Mr.
Kelly of the Conference Committee as strongly advocated
it. The members of the Conference Committees
of both Houses had unanimously approved the report,
and each of the managers had signed it. Mr. Kelly
answered the objections to this appropriation.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly: “I will say a word on this matter with
the permission of the gentleman from Virginia. The
Government owns the land between the Navy Yard
and the Marine Hospital. It is now all, or nearly all,
a swamp. A part has been filled in, and filled in, I
believe, for the very small price of sixteen cents a
yard. As the property now stands, it cannot be of
any use to the Government. Even if the Government
desires to sell, it would be a sound economy and
prudent foresight to first fill it in. It would then
command a large price. It extends for a considerable
way along what is called the Wallabout, and it shows
a complete water-front. If the Government filled it
in at the rate contracted for before, they might sell
lots there for large sums, which are now of no earthly
use to anybody. Until it is filled in the Marine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
Barracks ordered by Congress cannot be built; and
the Marines at that Yard are now quartered in sheds.
They are small, and not at all suitable for the purpose
for which they have been temporarily put up. I
hope, therefore, that this appropriation will be concurred
in. I am convinced that it is needed and
needed now.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The objectors, however, were unyielding, and the
report of the Committee of Conference was disagreed
to by a vote of 74 noes to 67 ayes.</p>

<p>The interests of Brooklyn always have had a warm
advocate in Mr. Kelly, and although in more recent
days he has found there some of his most active political
opponents, it may be doubted whether those
gentlemen have proved themselves truer friends of
the general interests of that great city than John
Kelly.</p>

<p>In a former chapter of this book allusion has been
made to the many gross misrepresentations of Mr.
Kelly’s motives and actions to which the press has
given circulation. A glaring instance of this bearing
of false witness against the neighbor is to be found in
a volume entitled <cite>The American Irish</cite>, by “Philip
H. Bagenal, B. A., Oxon.” This Mr. Bagenal seems
to be, not an American Irishman, but an English
Irishman of the London Tory variety, whose booklet
smacks of the facile courtier of some Cabinet Minister,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
not far off from Downing Street or Pall Mall.
It is a libel on Ireland and Irishmen at home and
abroad, now on Mr. Parnell in Wicklow, and again
on Mr. Kelly in New York. Bagenal writes not so
well, but after the fashion of Dr. Russell, another
English Irishman, familiarly known as “Bull Run
Russell.” The latter’s vulgar caricatures of President
Lincoln, in his letters to the London <cite>Times</cite>, caused
his expulsion from the military lines of the Federal
army during the war. Peripatetic book-makers from
abroad, who take hasty journeys through this country,
generally contrive to pick up a budget of miscellaneous
misinformation, which they cram into misbegotten
books, and offer for sale in the London market.
Mr. Bagenal’s mission appears to have been to contribute
an English tract on Irish life in the United
States, for English partisan use in Ireland. To say that
the alleged facts in this book are frequently untrue,
is to characterize the performance very mildly. Mr.
Parnell and his followers, according to Bagenal, are
enemies of Ireland, and architects of ruin and anarchy
only less reprehensible than the dynamiters.</p>

<p>“In New York,” says this scribe of the London
<cite>Times</cite>, “we find the Irish dying faster than any
others, less given to marriage than any others, and
more given to hard work and fasting than any others.
* * I visited the tenement houses in New York
where the Irish population dwell. * * Everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
the moral atmosphere is one of degradation
and human demoralization. Gross sensuality prevails.
The sense of shame, if ever known, is early stifled.
* * Thus live the descendants of the great Irish
exodus of 1845-48. * * They sought such occupation
as offered; they underbid labor, adapted themselves
manfully to the conditions of industry, or joined
the rabble that trooped as ‘ballot-stuffers’ and ‘shoulder-hitters’
in the train of the Tweeds, the Morrisseys,
and the Kellys of the day; and so became the scourge
of American politics. In those bygone days when the
Irish-American nation began to grow on Yankee soil,
had Government directed and assisted the tide of emigration,
hundreds of thousands would have been carried
out West; where, accustomed to agricultural
pursuits, they would have become quiet and prosperous
citizens, instead of fire-brands and perpetuators of the
animosity between England and Ireland.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>This slanderous picture of the Irish population in
New York is followed by an account of Bishop Ireland’s
noble efforts to build up an Irish colony in
Minnesota, and the great West. Mr. Bagenal holds
up Mr. Kelly as an enemy of this great movement.
What a pity he did not ask Bishop Ireland, with
whom, he says, he became acquainted at St. Paul, who
were the leading co-workers with that pious churchman
in opening up a home for Irish settlers in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
new States of the West? Bagenal would have learned
from Bishop Ireland, had he sought to know the truth,
that John Kelly had aided this philanthropic work by
giving to the Bishop one thousand dollars, afterwards
increased to nearly two thousand, as a contribution to
the St. Paul Catholic Colonization Bureau. Knowledge
of this circumstance probably would not have deterred
Bagenal, the vilifier of Mr. Parnell, from describing
Mr. Kelly as the enemy to Irish colonization in the
West. The typical London snob abroad is revealed in
the mendacious sentence concerning “the rabble that
trooped as ‘ballot-stuffers’ and ‘shoulder-hitters’ in
the train of the Tweeds, the Morrisseys and the Kellys
of the day,” and sufficiently proves the Downing Street
inspiration of this Tory romancer, who, it appears from
his preface, is a writer for the London <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p>John Kelly, throughout his whole career, has been
an earnest advocate for the settlement on the fertile
prairies of the West of the poor emigrants who crowd
into the Eastern cities, too often to starve for the
want of employment. Twenty-seven years ago he
introduced one of the first Homestead bills brought
forward in Congress, which was a statesmanlike effort
to relieve the overcrowded population of the great
cities, and to build up the prosperity and happiness of
the struggling masses of his fellow-citizens. He supported
this bill in a speech of great vigor, in which
he pointed out the advantages of homes in the West<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
to the poor, and sought to place the acquisition of
such homes within the reach of every citizen of the
United States, who wished to become an actual settler
upon the teeming millions of land that then belonged
to the Government. Had his bill been passed, the
gigantic railroad monopolies of to-day might not be in
possession of the mighty landed empire which they, in
so many cases, acquired by fraud, and hold by corruption,
against the rights of the people of the United
States.</p>

<p>On the 18th of January, 1858, Mr. Kelly introduced
a bill in Congress to secure homesteads to actual
settlers upon the public domain. The bill was read a
first and second time, and referred to the Committee
on Agriculture. This great measure which Mr. Kelly
then brought forward, one of the most beneficent that
ever claimed attention in the American Congress, was
originally introduced by Andrew Johnson, March 27,
1846, then a Representative in Congress from Tennessee.
More than six years elapsed before the House
acted on this bill, but the indomitable Andrew Johnson,
future President of the United States, persevered
in his statesmanlike advocacy of the measure, and the
House of Representatives finally passed it May 12,
1852, by a majority of two thirds. The bill, unfortunately,
failed in the Senate. The same bill, in
substance, was again introduced in the House in 1853
by John L. Dawson of Pennsylvania, where it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
passed a second time by an overwhelming majority.
As it had done before, the Senate again rejected the
bill, under the mistaken notion that it would weaken
some of the old States to allow a flood-tide of population
to pour into the new ones.</p>

<p>The next attempt to carry through the measure in
Congress, and to bestow happy homesteads on homeless
millions of American citizens, was that of Mr.
Kelly of January 18th, 1858. About the same time
Andrew Johnson, then a Senator, introduced a similar
bill in the Senate, and became, as before, its powerful
champion. The House, being in the Committee of
the Whole, May 25, Mr. Kelly made one of the ablest
speeches of his life on the Homestead Bill. The
length of the speech, and the scope of this volume,
preclude its reproduction here. A few extracts are
all that can be given:</p>

<p>“Mr. Chairman,” said he, “I regret that the bill
which I had referred to the Committee on Agriculture,
in the early part of this Session, has not as yet been
reported on, as I would have much preferred addressing
my remarks on the homestead question to the bill
itself. I will take occasion to observe, in passing, that
the Committees of this House have been prompt in
making their reports even on matters that sink into
insignificance when compared with the question of
giving an humble homestead to actual settlers on the
lands of the Government. If the Committee should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
think proper to delay their report much longer, I shall
feel it to be my duty, at an early day, to move for
their discharge from the further consideration of the
subject, and ask leave to bring the bill directly before
the House. If the Senate bill does not reach us in
the meantime, I may fail even in this way to secure a
vote on the question; but I will have the consolation
to know that I have done my duty to those of our
fellow-citizens who are either too modest or too poor
to command much influence in this Hall.”</p>

<p>“The main provision of the bill now before the
Committee consists in the liberal appropriation contained
in the first section, in the following words:
‘That any person who is the head of a family, or who
has arrived at the age of twenty-one years, and is a
citizen of the United States, or who shall have filed
his intention to become such, as required by the naturalization
laws of the United States, shall, from and
after the passage of this act, be entitled to enter, free
of cost, one quarter section of vacant and unappropriated
public lands which may, at the time the application
is made, be subject to private entry, at $1.25
per acre, or a quantity equal thereto, to be located in a
body, in conformity with the legal sub-divisions of the
public lands, and after the same shall have been surveyed.’”</p>

<p>“The other sections of the bill are either explanatory
of the first, or designed to guard against mistake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
or fraud in its execution. Its general purport and
object is, as its title indicates, to secure homesteads to
actual settlers on the public domain.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly next enters into a minute history of the
vast extent of the public lands of the United States,
how and when title to them was acquired, from whom
derived, and an interesting resumè of the subject from
a period anterior to the adoption of Articles of Confederation
between the thirteen original States, down
to the latest acquisition of territory in 1854, known
as the Gadsden Purchase. After an instructive review
of European, and especially of English colonization,
he continues as follows:</p>

<p>“But, sir, humanity claims for this bill the serious
consideration of every member of this House, more
especially of those who, like myself, represent in part
any of the large and populous cities of the Union.
For the laboring classes, large cities and towns, with
superabundant populations, are too often but the
portals from wretchedness to death. They can find
no employment whereby to earn their bread by the
sweat of their brow, and idleness, poverty and crime
are the inevitable results. The very shifts they resort
to, the avocations they follow in quest of subsistence,
even if they desire to live honestly, yield but scarcely
sufficient to supply unwholesome, scanty, unnutritious
diet; and hence the statistics of city life exhibit a
frightful mortality. * * Does not humanity, then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
as well as patriotism, invoke our favorable action on
a bill which will withdraw from our large cities this
overplus population, and by giving a proper incentive
to its industry and labor, rescue it from pauperism
and death? It is not for the worthless vagrant who
is found in every large city, lurking amid the haunts
of vice and wretchedness, I appeal. This pauperism
strikes down those who are able and willing to work,
and, therefore, are fit subjects for the bounty of Congress.
It is a truism in political economy that when
pauperism siezes upon this class of citizens, the wages
of labor are reduced to the cost of subsistence. The
whole class must therefore be subjected to the necessity
of working, rather to avoid the poor-house than
to better their condition. Rescue these and such as
these, not only from New York or Boston, or New
Orleans or Baltimore, but from every city, and town,
and village in the Union; rescue them from drudgery
and death, and transform them into useful and industrious
citizens of a free Republic. The earth which
God made is man’s. Give him, at least, a share of it,
a spot for a cot and a garden, and a grave when he
dies, else God will hold us as usurpers and faithless
stewards, when the great day of reckoning shall
come.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Nothing in the political career of John Kelly has
been more marked than his hostility to the great land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
cormorants, particularly the railroad corporations, and
in nearly all his public utterances from that day to
this he has uniformly denounced the venal men who
have controlled the lobbies of Congress, and bought
legislation by bribery and gifts, whereby they have
usurped so vast a part of the public domain. A true
history of Congressional grants to those corporations
has yet to be written. The annals of Congress show
nothing so disgraceful, and so disastrous to the public
welfare, as the wholesale donations of the lands of the
people to the great railroad monopolists.</p>

<p>In closing this rapid sketch of John Kelly’s Congressional
career, it may be observed that necessarily
many things have been omitted which properly should
find a place in his complete biography. The object
sought here is to elucidate his character, and the transactions
which have been selected for this purpose were
among those in which he more especially displayed
the bent of his mind, his love of human kind, and the
practical business direction of his thoughts and language.
Mr. Kelly had not reached his thirty-fourth
year when he entered Congress. He had had no
former experience in National politics, and was called
upon to contend with statesmen of great ability, long
service, and with a large following in the House.
Two or three terms are required, generally, before
members can hope to attain prominence as legislators
and debaters in a body where men of so much ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
are in rivalry for the palm of superiority. In spite of
these obstacles, Mr. Kelly took rank among the leading
men even during his first term, and during his
second he was placed on the Committee of Ways and
Means, the most important committee of the House,
was recognized as one of the leaders of his party, and
wielded an influence with the Administration scarcely
exceeded by any one. Had he remained in the House
of Representatives, considering the high position he
won there in two terms, and judging from the remarkable
ability he has displayed in his subsequent
career, in all probability John Kelly would have
become one of those few great parliamentary worthies
whose names occupy so large a space in American
history. He has given ample evidence that he possessed
the requisite qualifications to have succeeded
Stephen A. Douglas as leader of the Northern Democracy,
when death snatched the sceptre from the
hands of that gifted man. Of the calibre of Kelly,
the reader has seen the opinions in the preceding
pages which were expressed by such weighty statesmen
as Lewis Cass, and Alexander H. Stephens. The
gauge and measurement which those distinguished
men took of him over a quarter of a century ago have
been justified by the events of the past fifteen years,
and the marvellous grip upon the minds and imagination
of the American people which the very name of
Kelly has come to possess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>Hardly had he taken his seat in Congress when he
was confronted by Wm. H. Seward, as leader of the
Banks forces, in the famous contest over the Speakership
in the Thirty-fourth Congress, and yet after nine
weeks of stubborn battle in the House, John Kelly
named a candidate, William Aiken, as competitor
against Mr. Seward’s candidate, and Aiken came
within two votes, in a House containing seventy-four
Democrats and one hundred and four Republicans, of
beating Mr. Banks for Speaker of the House of Representatives.
In his second struggle with Mr. Seward,
when the Collectorship of the Port of New York was
at stake, Mr. Kelly may be said to have entered the
lists almost single handed against a powerful adverse
interest in the Senate and House from his own State.
He was, nevertheless, completely successful in securing
the confirmation by the Senate of Augustus Schell
for that office, as he had been mainly instrumental in
procuring his nomination by President Buchanan.
In a letter to a friend in New York, written some
time after, Mr. Kelly said: “Mr. Schell’s nomination
was opposed very bitterly by a large number of Democrats,
and I have no doubt but that it was my influence
with Clay, Orr, Dowdell, Shorter, Fitzpatrick,
and I might say quite a number of the members of
the Senate, that brought about the confirmation of
Mr. Schell.” John Kelly and Augustus Schell were
devoted personal and political friends, although in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
factional divisions in New York the former had been
a Soft Shell and the latter a Hard Shell Democrat.
They stood shoulder to shoulder in victory and defeat,
thinking the same things about the Republic, inseparable
in affection and fellowship throughout a long
and tempestuous period in the politics of the country.
In city, State and National conventions of the Democratic
party these two men always appeared together,
and in their journeys to and fro they travelled together,
roomed together, sat at the same table, and
presented a picture to the public eye of more than
brotherly affection. In looking at them, as they conversed
with each other at such times, one would be
reminded of Gales and Seaton in real life, or of the
Cheeryble Brothers of romance. The death of Mr.
Schell, in 1884, was a grievous blow to Mr. Kelly.
All who heard his speech at the memorial meeting for
his departed friend at Tammany Hall, will remember
the unwonted emotions under which he labored.</p>

<p>Society at the Capital during Mr. Kelly’s day in
Congress was very agreeable and homelike, and the
manners and tastes of the people were formed in the
school of frugality and simplicity well befitting a
Democratic Republic. Boast as men may of the
material progress of the country, the old school which
held sway at Washington, during Democratic Administrations,
was the nursery of civic virtues, and had
about it the flavor of the golden age of the fathers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
This was the school Jefferson founded, and Madison
and Monroe illustrated. It was the school in which
appeared John Taylor of Caroline, Rufus King,
William Pinkney, Governor Gore, Josiah Quincy,
William Gaston, and Littleton Waller Tazewell.
Along Pennsylvania Avenue John Marshall and
Daniel Webster might be seen wending their way to
market with baskets on their arms, while Chancellor
Bibb has gone fishing to the Long Bridge, John
Quincy Adams to have a swim in the Potomac, and
John C. Calhoun has gone out in the old-fashioned
omnibus to Georgetown College to talk philosophy
with Father Dzierozynsky.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This society was based
on simplicity, the heritage handed down from Revolutionary
soldiers, offshoot of freedom and downrightness.
There was no charlatanism in Washington
then, neither had there been any since Jefferson came
to tell the people “we are all Republicans, all Federalists.”
For fifty years the official rogues could be
counted on the ten fingers. How different in that
respect since the antique school has passed away. The
great wars have blown out the old-fashioned virtues,
and money-changers have unhinged the morality of
the people. Corruption in high places has prevailed,
and it has been in Washington as it was in Rome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
during the last days of the Empire, when Fabricius
and Tully were forgotten, and turgid and loquacious
rhetoricians mouthed in the Capitol. The golden age
of manners, and tastes, and honest living still survived
while the subject of this memoir sat in Congress. To
be a gentleman above reproach was glorious. Poverty
was no badge of disgrace, for James Monroe had given
his fortune to the country in the war of 1812, and died,
“like rigid Cincinnatus, nobly poor.” Henry Clay could
never reach the White House, because after the fashion
of the simple great ones he would rather be right than
President. Webster was an old school patriot, for
after Calhoun’s speech in 1833, he modified his views
so greatly that he never afterwards denied that the
Government of the United States was a compact between
sovereign States. The rule of right living was
so inflexible that Calhoun relinquished all hopes for
the Presidency, rather than have his wife visit Bellona,
at the dictation of General Jackson.</p>

<p>Happy days! Fortunate John Kelly! to have been
there to witness the antique social phases, and to
have come away again before the era was quite passed
and gone, and another and a different one had arisen
in its place.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, 1858, having been elected
Sheriff of the City and County of New York, November
2d of that year, Mr. Kelly resigned his seat
in the Thirty-fifth Congress. He remained in Washington
at his post until it was necessary to go to New
York to enter upon his new office; but in refreshing
contrast to those Representatives in a subsequent Congress,
the Forty-second, who voted themselves back-pay,
he declined, after his election as Sheriff, to draw
any salary at all for his service as a member of Congress.
The total number of votes cast at the election
for Sheriff was 69,088, of which John Kelly received
39,090, and William H. Albertson received 29,837,
scattering 161. Kelly was the regular nominee of
the Democratic party of the city. His majority was
9,092.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>He entered with characteristic energy upon the
duties of Sheriff, that most ancient of county officers
known to the common law, <em>Vice-comes</em> to the Earl, as
Blackstone calls him. The difficulties and responsibilities
of this office in New York are peculiarly great.
The reported cases upon Sheriff’s law in that city
indicate the immense number of statutes applicable
to the office, and the subtleties, refinements, and nice
legal distinctions, together with the liabilities, which
constantly press upon the Sheriff in the discharge of
his duties. As laymen nearly always have been elected
to the office, it was the rule, before Kelly’s term, for
incumbents to rely for guidance upon legal advisers
and prompters behind the scenes, whose special knowledge
of business was supplemented by professional
knowledge of law, and by training and experience in
the office. But John Kelly set resolutely to work
with his law books, for it is one of the leading traits
of his character to perform conscientiously whatever
duties are imposed upon him, and he was determined
to delegate to no one else a labor which the people
had elected him to do himself. While he was in the
office the Under-Sheriff ceased to be the High-Sheriff.
After reading one or two good elementary books, he
next applied himself to the Code of Procedure, the
Revised Statutes, and Reported Cases, and wrote out
a syllabus, or private digest for himself, of opinions
delivered in the lower Courts and the Court of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
Appeals in relation to Sheriff’s law. To master such
questions he worked with unflagging zeal, not only
by day but far into the night, during the greater part
of his term. In the meantime he acquired familiarity
with the routine and usages of the office. Thus
equipped, he was perhaps the first Sheriff who thoroughly
understood the duties of the office, and discharged
them in person. He became a favorite
among the members of the bar, and was an authority,
theoretically and practically, upon disputed questions
of Sheriff’s law. In the Sheriff’s Court Mr. Kelly
himself presided over the intelligent juries there empanelled.
He heard arguments of counsel, passed
upon authorities cited, was conversant in the law
applicable to cases, and in the opinion of leading
members of the profession he displayed a judicial
mind of high order.</p>

<p>The best body of jurors in the United States is
undoubtedly the Sheriff’s Jury in New York city.
The members of this jury are chosen annually by an
eminent Commission of judicial and other high officers,
and are selected from among the foremost citizens in
the community, whose wealth, intelligence, and established
character afford a guarantee of their freedom
from improper influences. Large fines for absence
are imposed, and cheerfully paid. An annual banquet,
known of all men, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubique gentium</i>, as the Sheriff’s
Jury’s Dinner, is provided for with the ample sum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
thus accumulated. Delmonico’s choicest menu is laid
under requisition, and a distinguished and brilliant
company is always brought together.</p>

<p>That accomplished and discerning gentleman, Mr.
Rosewell G. Rolston, President of the Farmers’ Loan
and Trust Company of New York, was one of the
members of the Sheriff’s Jury during Mr. Kelly’s
term. He once expressed to the writer of these pages
his high respect for the Sheriff, and descanted upon
his sturdy qualities, saying, that while he was a stern
and austere man to look at, he was, nevertheless,
brimful of kindly human nature. After mentioning
some occurrences which had come under his own
observation, he said, with no little earnestness, “John
Kelly is a love of a man, a grand fellow undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>Under-Sheriffs had presided at the trial of Sheriff’s
cases before Mr. Kelly’s entry into the office. The
Jury was surprised now to see the usual rule broken,
and the new Sheriff going upon the bench himself.
The more experienced members gave each other a
smile of astonishment and a knowing wink, for they
suspected that Kelly was led away by zeal, and by
ignorance of the mysteries of the law, into whose
knotty labyrinths he would be plunged presently by
wrangling lawyers. But Mr. Rolston and his fellow-jurors
quickly discovered that the imperturbable
Sheriff behaved like a veteran under legal fire, and
the lawyers themselves were surprised to find him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
not only familiar with questions at issue, both of
traverse and demurrer, but practically master of the
situation. He had broken the precedent, and what
had been before a fiction was now a fact, a Sheriff of
New York who knew more about his office than any
of his subordinates. John Kelly made a reputation
for honesty and capacity as Sheriff, which in the
whole history of the office has never been excelled by
any man who has occupied it. The best evidence
of this is found in the fact that at the earliest moment
when he was eligible under the Constitution
of the State, namely, at the expiration of the term of
Sheriff Lynch, his immediate successor, John Kelly
was renominated and re-elected Sheriff of New York.
He is the only man since the foundation of the Government
who has been elected twice to this important
office. In the early day, before the Hamiltonian
or monarchical features of the State Constitution
had been abolished, and the Jeffersonian or elective
principle had been substituted for them by constitutional
amendment, the Governor and Council held
the appointment, not only of judicial and other great
officers, a most fruitful source of corruption and centralization,
but they were likewise clothed with the
power to appoint Sheriffs and County Clerks in the
several counties of the State. But twice only, in the
early history of the State, did the Council of Appointment
at Albany select the same men to fill a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
term as Sheriff of the city and county of New York.
Marinus Willett was appointed Sheriff of New York
in 1784, and served until 1787. He was re-appointed
in 1791, and held until 1795. Benjamin Ferris also
held the office by appointment from 1808 to 1810,
and again from 1811 to 1813. On the 6th of November,
1864, John Kelly, who had filled the office so
faithfully from 1859 to 1861, was re-elected Sheriff of
New York, an unprecedented honor, as well as endorsement
of his official integrity, now bestowed for the first
time in the history of the city, by the people themselves,
upon any individual.</p>

<p>At this election there were three candidates in the
field, two Democrats and a Republican, but after an
exciting canvass John Kelly led the poll by a plurality
of nearly 6,000, his Republican competitor coming
next. The whole number of votes for Sheriff was
106,707, of which Kelly received 42,022, John W.
Farmer 36,477, and Michael Connolly, commonly
called the “Big Judge,” 28,099. The number of
scattering votes was 109. Mr. Kelly’s second term
expired December 31, 1867. That it was a repetition
of the first one in his fidelity to the important interests
and duties confided to his charge, was universally
declared at the time, without one whisper of dissent.
In the fierce conflicts of party fifteen years after his
first term as Sheriff, and seven years after the second,
when his talents and commanding position in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
community had made him a formidable antagonist,
John Kelly’s official integrity as Sheriff was called in
question for the first time by certain political opponents,
whose misconduct he had exposed, and whose
arbitrary acts he had resisted. These tardy shafts of
malice fell harmless at his feet.</p>

<p>In the year 1868, eleven months after he had ceased
to be Sheriff a second time, a still handsomer testimonial
to the stainlessness of his character was tendered
to him than that implied in his re-election as Sheriff;
an emphatic endorsement of his qualifications for the
highest civic preferment was received by him when
the Democratic Union of New York nominated him for
Mayor of the city against A. Oakey Hall, the candidate
of the Tweed Ring. In a laudable and patriotic
attempt to drive the Ring from power at the Charter
election of November, 1868, New York’s best citizens,—merchants,
bankers, tradesmen, mechanics, and
members of the various professions, turned to John
Kelly to lead them, to the man whose admirable
administration of the trusts he had previously held as
Alderman, Congressman, and Sheriff, afforded satisfactory
proof of his fitness to grapple with the Ring, and
if elected, to crush it, and restore honesty and economy
in the various municipal offices.</p>

<p>Among those who looked to Mr. Kelly at this interesting
and critical hour in the history of New York,
as a safe leader against the notorious triumvirate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
Tweed, Sweeny and Connolly, were Samuel J. Tilden,
Andrew H. Green, Augustus Schell, and still another—tell
it not in Gath! mention it not in the streets
of Ascalon! for it is surprising to relate—Nelson J.
Waterbury himself. Yes, in the very next year after
John Kelly had ceased to be Sheriff, this gentleman,
who has since lavished so much savage abuse upon
him for mythical misdeeds as Sheriff, the self-same
Nelson J. Waterbury was an enthusiastic supporter of
John Kelly for Mayor of New York.</p>

<p>The support which Mr. Tilden was disposed to
bestow upon Mr. Kelly was a more important incident
of that eventful campaign. For a long time
they had been intimate acquaintances, and Tilden not
only looked upon Kelly as a man of invincible
honesty, but recognized in him a born leader of men.
It was a most unfortunate thing that Mr. Kelly’s
health, at this particular juncture, was so much impaired
that it was not possible for him to stand the
strain of such a contest, or, indeed, of any contest at
all. The blackest chapter in the history of New York
was about to be written. He felt the magnitude of
the occasion, and rose from a sick bed to go meet the
people half way, when they called him to lead them
in the fight. No personal sacrifice could be too great,
not even life itself, when the stakes were the reformation
of the public service, and the rescue of a million
people from the corrupt domination of such a Ring.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
“You will never live to reach the army,” said Voltaire
to the feeble and emaciated Mareschal de Saxe,
as the leader was setting out for Fontenoy. “The
object now,” replied the fiery commander, “is not to
live, but to go.” But Mr. Kelly, however willing to
act his part, soon found that nature’s barriers are not
to be overcome. The hand which had rejoiced in its
strength was relaxed and powerless under wasting
illness, and like that of Old Priam, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">telumque imbelle</i>,
no longer could strike an effectual blow. He was,
indeed, destined to smite the Tweed Ring a death-blow,
but not now, nor until four years had come and
gone, when, with health restored, and energies all on
fire, he drove them from Tammany Hall, and inscribed
his name among the benefactors of New York. He
lived, like Saxe, to fight and win his Fontenoy.</p>

<p>From early life Mr. Kelly had suffered from bronchial
troubles, which always were increased by public
speaking. His mind is intensely active. “I must be
occupied in some way,” he once said to a friend, “and
I can’t sit still five minutes without doing something.
I cannot be an idler.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Whatever he undertook to do,
his faculties became concentrated upon the task until
it was accomplished. His occupations for a long time
had been engrossing and laborious, and his health had
suffered under the strain. “For twenty years,” to
repeat the remark of the editor of the <cite>Utica Observer</cite>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
quoted in a preceding chapter of this volume, “he had
devoted several hours of every day to the pursuit of
literature and science,” and at length his constitution
was seriously impaired. Domestic afflictions also came
upon him about this period, and his physical maladies
were increased fourfold.</p>

<p>John Kelly had entered into wedlock when a very
young man, and for twenty years his circle of domesticity
was unclouded by a single shadow. His wife, <em>nèe</em>
McIlhargy, was the daughter of an Irish adopted citizen
of New York, and an interesting family, a son and
two daughters, grew up to the verge of manhood and
womanhood about him. Mrs. Kelly, whom the present
writer knew well, and greatly respected for the excellent
but unostentatious qualities of her character, was
a good wife, a devoted mother and a pious Christian
woman. In the year 1866 she fell a victim to consumption.
Her son Hugh, a bright and winning
young man, just as he had turned his twenty-first
year, succumbed to the same disease, and followed his
mother to the grave. Symptoms of consumption also
appeared in the daughters, and it was evident that
death had marked them both for its early victims.
To a man of John Kelly’s strongly affectionate nature,
wrapped up in his home and family, these visitations
falling upon him like unmerciful disasters, one after
another in quick succession, proved well nigh irreparable.
His health already impaired, gave way entirely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
and his friends were seriously apprehensive of
his own early demise.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of these afflictions that he was
nominated for Mayor against A. Oakey Hall. He
was placed in nomination by the Democratic Union,
which held its convention at Masonic Hall, November
18, 1868, and he received on the first ballot 240 votes,
to 51 for John W. Chanler, and 1 each for John
McKeon and Fernando Wood. On the second ballot
John Kelly received every vote in the convention, and
was declared the unanimous nominee for Mayor. A
committee was appointed by the chair, Mr. Roswell
D. Hatch, to notify Mr. Kelly of his nomination, and
to invite him before the convention. The chairman of
this committee was Mr. Nelson J. Waterbury. After
some time Mr. Kelly entered the hall escorted by Mr.
Waterbury, by whom he was presented to the convention
in appropriate terms, as the reform candidate for
Mayor.</p>

<p>He was warmly received, and made a brief speech,
vigorously denouncing the Tweed and Sweeny Ring,
which had usurped control of Tammany Hall. He
referred in terms of praise to those honest Democrats,
many of whom he saw before him, who formerly like
himself had been identified with the Wigwam, but who
had retired from it in disgust, as he himself had done
when the Ring obtained control. “I see many gentlemen
in this convention,” said Mr. Kelly, “who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
formerly were associated with me in Tammany Hall,
and who felt the same grievances there which I myself
have experienced. I have no desire for this nomination,
but while I have not sought it, I will only say
this, I shall stand by those who have so generously
nominated me for Mayor, and if elected, I will discharge
the duties of the office honestly and faithfully.
In accepting your nomination I fully realize that both
yourselves and myself will have to work strenuously
against the corrupt men opposing us, if we expect to
secure victory. But by working together in good
faith we can succeed, for the people of New York feel
the importance of the contest, and the necessity of
putting down the bad men who have obtained control
of the city government. I accept your nomination,
and if elected will do the best in my power to realize
all your legitimate expectations.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Abram R. Lawrence was nominated for Corporation
Counsel. The candidacy of Mr. Kelly greatly alarmed
the Ring leaders and their Republican allies. The
latter sought to control the Republican convention
which was held the next day, and force through a
straight Republican ticket for Mayor and Corporation
Counsel, as the most effective way to secure the
election of A. Oakey Hall. But fortunately there was
a reform element among the Republicans, as well as
among the Democrats, and the opponents of the Ring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
were in a majority in the Republican city convention.
That excellent citizen, Mr. Sinclair Tousey, was
President of this convention. The main struggle was
between those who favored the endorsement of John
Kelly for Mayor, and, therefore, wished the convention
to adjourn over, and those who advocated the prompt
nomination of a straight Republican ticket. The
latter class was led by Charles S. Spencer, who
vehemently demanded immediate action. But the
opponents of Spencer prevailed, and secured an adjournment
to the following Monday. “It was understood,”
remarked the <cite>Herald</cite> of November 20th,
“that the party of compromise was engaged in fixing
up quite a neat little arrangement, by which the Republicans
would endorse the nomination of John Kelly
for Mayor, in consideration of having Mr. Shaw
substituted for Mr. Lawrence as candidate for Corporation
Counsel. The compromisers gave out that
Spencer and the party of action were simply acting in
the interest of Tammany Hall in endeavoring to have
the Republican convention make regular nominations.”</p>

<p>In this campaign the <cite>Herald</cite> opposed John Kelly,
and championed A. Oakey Hall for Mayor. This
was not evidence of any complicity on the part of
that paper in the misconduct of the Ring, for in 1868
there was no positive proof in possession of the public
of the criminality of the Ring, and hence the <cite>Herald</cite>
or any other journal was not justly obnoxious to unfavorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
criticism at that early day in the history of
the plunderers for advocating the election of Hall.
“The Ring,” says Mr. Tilden in his history of its
overthrow, “became completely organized and matured
on the 1st of January, 1869, when Mr. A. Oakey
Hall became Mayor. Its duration was through 1869,
1870 and 1871.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The morning after Mr. Kelly’s nomination the
<cite>Herald</cite> declared for A. Oakey Hall and against Kelly,
in one of those plausible leading articles by which
it has so long and so remarkably influenced public
opinion for or against men and measures. The reference
to Mr. Kelly as a nabob was an adroit campaign
stroke, and although he was living quite unostentatiously
in a modest three-story brick house at the
corner of 38th Street and Lexington Avenue, an impression
was created that he was surrounded by
princely opulence, in the fashionable quarter among
the millionaires. The <cite>Herald</cite> editorial was as follows:</p>

<p>“John Kelly is a good citizen and a respectable
man; but he has already been elected by the Tammany
Democracy, to which he owes all his past political
favors, to the offices of Councilman, Alderman,
member of Congress, and twice to the valuable position
of Sheriff of New York, being the only man, we
believe, who has held that lucrative office a second
term. John Kelly was brought up a lad in the <cite>Herald</cite><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
office, when he first came to New York, and was well
brought up; but he went into politics in spite of his
early training. We supported him for office while he
was poor and lived in the locality of the Fourteenth
Ward. Now that he has made himself a millionaire,
and lives like a nabob in the high locality of one of the
most fashionable avenues of uppertendom, we think
he should be satisfied, and give place to others who
have not enjoyed such good fortune.”</p>

<p>“If the Democrats nominate A. Oakey Hall, as it
is said they will, as their candidate for Mayor, he will
no doubt be elected by a large majority. He will suit
those who take a pride in the dignity of the city, because
he is a man of superior ability, a profound
thinker, an eloquent talker, and understands thoroughly
the details of the municipal government.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The Ring men got thoroughly frightened after the
adjournment of the Republican City Convention without
a nomination, for it was becoming quite clear that
independent citizens, both outside and inside of the
respective political parties, meant to support Mr. Kelly
for Mayor against the Ring candidate. This state of
things caused the <cite>Herald</cite> to discard special pleading
respecting the “nabobs of uppertendom,” and to redouble
its attacks on Kelly. He was now denounced
as a deserter for having retired from Tammany Hall,
and joined the opponents of William M. Tweed. “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
fight,” said the <cite>Herald</cite>, “is to be made against the
Democratic organization with the object of breaking
down Tammany, and thus giving the death-blow to
the regular Democracy in its stronghold. The <cite>Tribune</cite>,
<cite>Times</cite> and <cite>World</cite> are co-laborers in this work—the
two former openly, and the latter in an underhanded
but not less vindictive manner. They are preparing
to unite on John Kelly, who has deserted the
Democratic organization for the purpose of leading
the Republican forces in the battle. District Attorney
A. Oakey Hall will be the Democratic nominee, and
will no doubt be elected; but it will be one of the
greatest fights we have ever had over a Charter election,
as the breaking down of the Democratic organization
at this end of the State would be the death-blow
of the party, and is therefore a stake worth
playing for by the Republicans, who feel the loss of
power in New York very severely.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Against this pretended but sham regularity, not only
Mr. Kelly, but Mr. Tilden also revolted. “Weighty
pressure,” says Tilden, “was brought on me from
powerful men all over the State to ‘save the party.’
I denied that the system of organization then in use
in the city had any moral right to be considered
regular, or to bind the Democratic masses. I told the
State Convention that I felt it to be my duty to oppose
any man who would not go for making the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
of this city what it ought to be, at whatever
cost, at whatever sacrifice. If they did not deem that
‘regular,’ I would resign as chairman of the State
Committee.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The exertion made by Mr. Kelly in leaving a sick
bed to go before the Democratic Union City Convention
to accept its nomination for Mayor, increased the
illness from which he suffered. His physician called
eminent doctors into consultation, and it was the
opinion of them all that his continuance in active
political movements would have a fatal result. This
professional decision was communicated to Mr. Kelly
by that eminent physician, the late Dr. Marion Sims.
Thus admonished that the excitement of the campaign
would kill him, Mr. Kelly, on the 27th of November,
reluctantly sent in his withdrawal from the Mayoralty
contest to the Executive Committee of the Democratic
Union, and the vacancy was filled by the nomination
of Mr. Frederick A. Conkling.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly, who was a sufferer from insomnia, soon
after sailed with his two daughters for Europe. He
made an extended tour in Europe, Asia and Africa,
visiting, among other places, the Holy Land. He first
went to Ireland as a pilgrim would return to the home
of his fathers, spending some time in the beautiful
Island of Saints, where Christianity made its only
bloodless conquest in the world. During fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
hundred years, while other Christian nations have
rushed back into infidelity and again become Christian,
Ireland has never lapsed into infidelity, nor into a scoffing,
Godless philosophy, the invariable accompaniment
of unbelief and paganism. After visiting the various
capitals of Europe,—London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin,
Madrid, St. Petersburg, and other places, he repaired
to Rome, the city of the soul, the Niobe of nations,
shrine of saints and martyrs, of doctors and confessors,
where he spent a considerable period in rest and retirement,
and in viewing its wonderful ruins, monuments,
and churches. Repairing to Holy Land, Mr. Kelly
remained for some time at Jerusalem, the cradle of
Christianity; which Titus, in fulfilment of prophecy,
left not a stone upon a stone of; where Christ had
walked about among the people, and where He died
upon Calvary.</p>

<p>In contemplating scenes associated with the earthly
life and death of the Redeemer, the traveler no doubt
derived comfort in his own bereavements, dignified by
such a fellowship of suffering as was there. What a
lesson of humility the ignominious Cross must have
preached to his reflective mind. He was leading a
contemplative life, and his letters at this period
dwell much upon the Mount of Olives, the Way of
the Cross, and the Holy Sepulchre. He had read
somewhere in allegory of the contest in which the
trees of the forest are represented as debating among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
themselves who should be their king. Had the contest
occurred in the days of the Redeemer, small
chance the ignoble tree of the Cross would have had
to win the crown. Mr. Kelly had read Cardinal
Wiseman’s beautiful thoughts on the subject. “Apply
the allegory,” said he once in a circle of his
friends, “and let us enter some forest of Judea
filled with stately trees, lofty, tapering pine, and
royal cedar, and hear the proud possessor give
orders as to how their worth should be realized
into wealth. He says to the forester: ‘See that
elegant and towering tree which has reached the
maturity of its growth, how nobly will it rise above
the splendid galley and bear itself in the fell fury of
the wind, without breaking or bending, and carry the
riches of the earth from one flourishing port to another.
Cut it down and destine it for this noble work. And
this magnificent cedar, overcasting all around it with
the solemnity of its shade, worthy to have been built
by Solomon into the temple of God, such that David
might have sung its praises on his inspired lyre; let
it be carefully and brilliantly polished, and embarked
to send to the imperial city, there to adorn those magnificent
halls, in which all the splendor of Rome is
gathered; and there, richly gilded and adorned, it
shall be an object of admiration for ages to come.’
‘It is well, my lord,’ replies his servant, ‘but this
strange, this worthless tree, which seems presumptuously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
to spring up, beneath the shadow of those
splendid shafts, what shall we do with it? it is fitted
for no great, no noble work.’ ‘Cut it down, and, if
of no other use, why, it will make a cross for the first
malefactor!’”</p>

<p>Strange counsels of men! The soaring pine dashed
the freight that it bore against the rocks, and rolled a
wreck upon the beach. The noble cedar witnessed
the revels of imperial Rome, and fell by the earthquake,
or in the fire kindled by the barbarians, charred
into ashes. But that ignoble tree, spurned by proud
man and put to the most ignominious of uses, bore the
price of the world’s redemption upon Calvary, its every
fragment has been gathered up, and treasured and
enshrined, and in every age it has been considered
worth all that the world dotes on, and sets its heart on.
An Empress crossed the seas and searched among the
tombs of the dead for that material wood of the Cross
of Christ. For that holy rood was built a magnificent
church on Mount Sion. For it the Emperor Heraclius
made war on the King of Persia; and when he
had recovered it, bore it as his Master had borne it
before, barefoot and in humble garb to Calvary. For
that tree Constantine the Great built a noble church,
yet standing among the ruins of the palaces of Rome,
and brought the very earth from the Savior’s own
land, as though none were worthy to be there save
that upon which had first fallen the precious blood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
redemption. For eighteen hundred years this relic
has been the most priceless treasure of Christians.
Its smallest fragment has been enshrined and vestured
in gold and precious stones, and housed and sheltered
in magnificent temples piled up with the richest materials
and noblest productions of art. The ignoble
tree which the world despised has conquered the world
itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly’s correspondence at this time made it
apparent that he had ceased to feel interest in the
busy trifles of politicians, and that his thoughts were
directed to problems of the moral world, to reveries
upon the mysteries of redemption, like that outlined
in the preceding allegory upon the Cross, and to the
works of mercy, both spiritual and corporal. He
brought back from Palestine souvenirs and patristic
relics of much interest. He had familiarized himself
with the topography of the hallowed scenes of Holy
Land, and those who have heard him describe them
and relate the history and traditions connected with
them, have been struck with his reverence as a narrator,
as well as with his closeness as an observer of
manners, customs and places. While he was abroad
unfounded rumors reached New York that John Kelly
had withdrawn from the world, in order to spend the
remainder of his days in monastic retirement. Perhaps
this story originated from the circumstance that
he travelled much in the company of clergymen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
Europe. Vicar-General Quinn of New York was
his companion on the Continent. The late Bishop
McGill of Richmond, Virginia, a man of ascetic tastes
and profound learning, often shared Mr. Kelly’s carriage
in the latter’s drives about Rome. Another
thing which may have given color to the rumor was
the fact that Mr. Kelly had educated, and was still
educating, many young men for the ecclesiastical state,
not only American youths, but those of Irish and
German and Swiss nationalities. While he was in
Switzerland his attention was directed by his daughters
to a pious little boy, the son of a poor gardener, who
with another boy of wealthy parentage, served at the
altar every morning. The wealthy man’s son soon departed
for the University, when Mr. Kelly sent for the
son of the gardener, and finding that he wished to
become a religious, told him that he would afford him
the means to carry out his purpose, and amid the
grateful tears and prayers of the boy’s parents, he sent
him to a renowned German University, and defrayed
all his expenses until he was graduated. That boy
has since become a learned scholar and minister at the
altar. While Mr. Kelly was in Rome he became
warmly interested in the American College, a noble
seat of learning in that city for the training of young
ecclesiastics for the American Missions, and he generously
established a bursary in the College. He gave
to its President, Dr. Chatard, who since has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
raised to the Episcopate, five thousand dollars for the
maintenance of this charitable Kelly foundation. It reflected
no credit upon the managers of the New York
Cooper Institute meeting, held in 1884, to denounce the
spoliation of the Propaganda, of which the American
College at Rome is a part, to have omitted one of its
benefactors, and so prominent a representative man as
John Kelly, from the list of the officers and speakers of
that meeting. Those managers were then burning
incense to Monsignor Capel, a clerical gentleman of
know—ledge, not knowledge, who thinks American
Catholics are too illiterate yet awhile to aspire to a
University.</p>

<p>The beautiful pictures in stained glass, which adorn
the windows of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York,
are, with the exception of the examples in the French
Cathedral in Chartres, perhaps unsurpassed in modern
times, as figured scenes from the Scriptures and lives
of the saints. In this pictorial religious epic is a beautiful
window placed there by John Kelly in memory
of his lost ones, or more correctly of those members
of his family who have been called to the better life.
“Before quitting the Sanctuary,” says the writer of a
pamphlet descriptive of the exterior and interior of
the Cathedral, “we will bend our steps towards the

<p>Some years before the completion of the new
Cathedral, and while Mr. Kelly was in Rome, he
gave an order to a celebrated artist in that
city of art treasures to execute for him four great
oil paintings representing the Baptism of our Lord,
the Marriage feast of Cana, the Return of the Prodigal
Son, and St. Patrick preaching at Tara. He
afterwards embraced two additional scenes from sacred
history in his scheme, the Ascension of Our Lord, and
the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin. The artist,
Galliardi, produced a noble work after the best
masters. These six magnificent paintings were sent
from Rome to America as a present from Mr. Kelly
to St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and are the only paintings
in canvas upon the walls of that grand church.</p>

<p>When he was in England he visited a region inhabited
almost entirely by miners—English, Irish and
Welsh. Those people were, to a great extent, ignorant
of the truths of Christianity, and there were no facilities
in the wild mountain region they inhabited to
improve their moral condition. Working in the mines
day and night, and constantly exposed to death in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
midst of their subterranean toil, these poor people
appealed to friends at a distance to send them a
clergyman to minister to their spiritual wants. The
appeal was answered, and the Reverend Mr. Dealy
arrived there to open a mission a short time before
Mr. Kelly visited that part of England. The clergyman
found himself destitute of every worldly appliance
for a proper ministration of the functions of his
spiritual office, no church, no school-house, no charitable
home or asylum for the sick and helpless, all
things, in a word, wanting, and no adequate means to
provide them. He was an excellent and zealous man,
and he stated his situation, and the necessities of the
people to Mr. Kelly. He told him that if he had the
money to build a church and school-house, incalculable
good might be done. He poured his story into sympathetic
ears. Help was promised, and faithfully was
the promise kept. Mr. Dealy some time after, upon
Mr. Kelly’s invitation, set sail for America, and took
up his residence in the latter’s house. When Mr.
Kelly reached home he organized a movement among
those of his immediate friends, whose opulence and
charity admitted of the appeal, and in the course of a
few months Mr. Dealy, as he informed the writer of
these pages, was the fortunate possessor of a purse of
over twelve thousand dollars, inclusive of Mr. Kelly’s
own handsome donation. Those poor miners in England
soon had their church, and a school for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
children, and their pastor had reason to bless the day
when he first made the acquaintance of the subject of
this memoir.</p>

<p>After John Kelly had re-entered the field of politics,
and even when immersed in public affairs, his charity
and philanthropy continued to be the controlling principles
of his conduct. During the past five or six
years he has been a frequent lecturer in various
cities of the Union. His lectures, respectively upon
the Sisters of Charity, the Early Jesuit Missionaries
in North America, and upon the Irish Settlers in
North and South America, were replete with historical
information and sound practical instruction, and wherever
he appeared on the platform as a lecturer he
always drew crowded houses. Mr. Kelly realized from
his lectures, which he delivered repeatedly in the
North, South and West, over fifty thousand dollars,
and this immense sum he gave in charity to educate
and clothe the poor, to build schools, or to lift the
burden of debt from charitable institutions. His heart
was in his work. He would not allow one penny of
the proceeds of his lectures to be diverted from the
sweet uses of charity for his traveling expenses, but
in every instance, wherever he went to lecture, he
insisted on paying his railroad fare, and hotel bills, out
of his own pocket.</p>

<p>Bagenal, the London traducer of the American
Irish, with unblushing mendacity, classes John Kelly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
as a leader of “shoulder-hitters and ballot-stuffers,”
and ignorantly accuses him of being an enemy of Irish
colonization in the West. The simple truth is that
Kelly is one of the originators and prime leaders in
the movement to get poor emigrants out of the overcrowded
Eastern cities, and has contributed thousands
of dollars to make their colonization in the West a
success.</p>

<p>Dr. Ireland, Bishop of St. Paul, Minnesota, one of the
great pioneers in this benign scheme, while speaking
kindly of Mr. Bagenal in a letter to the present writer,
still shows how erroneous he is in his strictures upon
Mr. Kelly. The Bishop’s comment upon Bagenal,
is as follows: “He is mistaken, of course, in his remarks
about Mr. John Kelly. But I do not think he
will be sorry to be set right. He mixes up Mr. Kelly
with the average politicians of New York—not knowing,
as I know, Mr. Kelly’s exceptional qualities, his
sterling honesty, his true love for his fellow-Irishmen,
and his general nobility of character.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>When he retired from politics in 1868, Mr. Kelly
had resolved to enter upon that field no more. Chastened
by domestic affliction, and loss of health, the
plan of his life was changed. Public station had lost
its charm for him. To feed the hungry, clothe the
naked, and open the doors of colleges, or advanced
schools, to those whose talents were good, but who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
were too poor to gain admittance, these things afforded
to him his greatest pleasure. He sought out the companionship
of holy men, and of holy books. Thomas à Kempis
became his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vade mecum</i>. He took more
delight in the pages of the Following of Christ than
he had ever known in the conflicts of politics, either
in the halls of Congress or the city of New York. It
was not altogether surprising, therefore, that people’s
conjectures should consign him to the prospective
seclusion of a monastery, and that rumors to that
effect should have gained circulation. The <cite>New
York Times</cite>, on one occasion, shortly after Mr. Kelly’s
second marriage, made editorial reference to these
rumors, and spoke of him as that remarkable individual
who had escaped being a monk at Rome, in
order to become the nephew of a Cardinal in America.</p>

<p>These revelations of the inner life of John Kelly are
not laid before the public without a great deal of reluctance.
Some may think it were better to keep
them back until after his death, and the writer knows
perfectly well that no one else would prohibit their
publication at any time, or under any conceivable circumstances
more sternly than John Kelly himself.
But these pages have been written without consultation
with any human being in the world, and recollecting
the unparalleled and shameful abuse which
this man has been subjected to for doing his duty as
God has given him to see it, the writer is resolved to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
tell the truth about him, and let the unprejudiced
reader know something of his real character. Indeed
hardly a tithe of those charities and good works of
John Kelly which are within the personal knowledge
of the present writer, have been mentioned in these
pages. During the war for the Union, especially,
were the kindly impulses of his nature displayed. He
went about among the hospitals visiting and cheering
the sick and despondent, supplying articles for their
relief and money for their wants, and doing what he
could for the wounded. He did not confine these
ministrations to the hospitals in New York, but went
to Washington and got a pass from Edwin M. Stanton,
Secretary of War, whom he had known well in former
years, to visit the Army of the Potomac, and particularly
the camp hospitals. Thither he repaired, and
extended his aid not only to New York soldiers but to
those of other States, with characteristic zeal and
liberality. A letter was published in the New York
<cite>World</cite>, November 1st, 1875, from Mr. James Murphy,
in which reference is made to one of Mr. Kelly’s
visits to the army in Virginia.</p>

<p>“I well recollect,” said the writer, “that thirteen
years ago, when I was a soldier in the Second Army
Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and stationed at
Stafford Heights, Virginia, opposite Fredericksburg, I
had the pleasure of meeting Mr. John Kelly. His
mission was one of the noblest that man ever followed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
He was going round from hospital to hospital, and from
tent to tent, visiting the sick and wounded of the poor
and neglected soldiers of the New York regiments, to
see to their wants, and alleviate their sufferings as much
as lay within his power, and questioning them as to their
treatment as compared with the treatment of the
soldiers of other States.” Many persons in the border
States, as those adjoining the scene of military operations
were called, who were guilty of no disloyal acts,
were nevertheless made victims of spies and detectives,
and they and their families suffered great hardships.
One of these was Mr. John Henry Waring, a prominent
and wealthy citizen of Prince George’s County,
Maryland, whose property was confiscated, whose
large family, mostly ladies, were banished, and who
was himself imprisoned for the war in Fort Delaware.
This was the work of Baker, the notorious detective,
and a more cruel persecution hardly occurred during
the war. Mr. Kelly was appealed to on behalf of Mr.
Waring, and after he was satisfied that injustice had
been done to that excellent citizen, he went to Washington
and saw Mr. Lincoln, and Secretaries Stanton
and Montgomery Blair, on behalf of the Waring
family and estate. But Baker had poisoned the mind
of Stanton against the Warings, and, notwithstanding
the Secretary’s regard for Mr. Kelly, he refused the
clemency that was asked. Mr. Kelly returned to
New York, and enlisted in Mr. Waring’s favor the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
powerful co-operation of Governor Morgan, Archbishop
Hughes, Thurlow Weed, James T. Brady, and
about fifty other leading men, and, thus strengthened,
he renewed the appeal for justice and executive clemency.
Postmaster General Blair had become warmly
interested in the case, and to him Mr. Kelly confided
the petition of the citizens of New York named above,
and Mr. Blair in conjunction with Mr. Kelly ceased
not to press the case until Mr. Waring was liberated,
his family were recalled from banishment, and his
beautiful home and plantation on the Patuxent river
were restored to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly returned from Europe in the fall of 1871,
much improved in health, but not yet restored to his
old vigor. The present writer gave to Mr. J. E. Mallet,
of Washington, D. C., who was going to Europe,
a letter of introduction to Mr. Kelly, while the latter
was abroad. Although they were near each other
several times in Europe, Mr. Mallet did not become
acquainted with Mr. Kelly until they accidentally met
on the same steamship, the <cite>Republic</cite>, in returning to
America. In a letter published in the Baltimore
Catholic <cite>Mirror</cite>, Mr. Mallet gave an interesting
account of this voyage, and of the amusements improvised
on shipboard. “One evening,” said he, “we
organized a musical and literary entertainment. The
chairman made a speech, a lady played a fine musical
composition, a gentleman gave a recitation, a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
bride sang a beautiful ballad, Hon. John Kelly, of
New York, sang in excellent style an amusing Irish
song, then a duet was sung by two ladies, some
one sang a French song, Father Sheehy sang an
Irish ballad on St. Patrick, and the entertainment
concluded, and the assemblage dispersed during the
reading by the Rev. Dr. Arnot, of one of his old
sermons.”</p>

<p>“A valued friend had given me a letter of introduction
to Mr. Kelly, to present in France or Switzerland,
but I met that gentleman only on the wharf at
Liverpool, and then almost accidentally. Mr. Kelly
has travelled throughout Europe and the Holy Land,
and is one of the most interesting travelling companions
whom I have ever met. I was particularly
pleased with his manner of presenting the true history
of, and reasons for certain religious and national practices
in Ireland and Italy, in opposition to the theories
and suppositions of certain of our fellow-voyagers,
who ignorantly calumniated the one, and ridiculed the
other.”</p>

<p>During the three years of Mr. Kelly’s absence in
Europe, New York had been given over to every form
of official rascality and plunder. No sooner had he
reached the city than he was besieged by leading citizens,
such as Mr. Tilden, Mr. Schell, Mr. Hewitt, Mr.
Belmont, Mr. Chanler, Mr. Clark, Mr. Green and
others, all of whom urged him to take the lead in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
movement for the overthrow of the Tweed Ring. To
each one of these gentlemen he said that it was not in
accord with the plan of life which he had marked out
for himself for the future, to re-enter the field of active
politics. But his friends redoubled their importunities.
They told him there was no other man in New
York, scarcely one in the United States, so well fitted
as himself to head such a movement, and that in the
lifetime of but very few persons did so grand an
opportunity offer itself to serve the people as that
which now awaited him. His friends finally prevailed,
his private plans were changed, and his memorable reappearance
in New York politics occurred in the year
1872. “My health remains about the same as when I
saw you,” said Mr. Kelly, in 1872, in a letter to the
present writer. “I was compelled to take part, for the
reason that my old associates would not take No for
answer. My active participation has not helped me
much in point of health, nor does it seem possible for
me to live in New York without being more or less
mixed up in politics.” In an interview published in
the New York <cite>World</cite>, October 18, 1875, Mr. Kelly
explained more fully how he was induced to return to
politics. Details omitted, the salient points of that
interview were as follows: “When I returned from
Europe in the fall of 1871, it was my intention to have
nothing to do with politics at all. I had been sorely
afflicted by the loss of my family, and I wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
spend the rest of my life as a private business man. I
was met by a number of leading men, who told me
that during my absence the Democratic party in the
city had become utterly demoralized, and that the
Grant Republicans, taking advantage of this state of
affairs, had come into full possession in this great
Democratic city, and they begged me to assume an
active part. I had hundreds of the leading men in
the city here at my house, asking me to take hold and
help them up. After much importunity, I consented,
and threw my whole heart into the work. I suppose
I have some foresight. I think I generally see things
pretty clearly, and this is probably why they trust to
my judgment. Whenever I fail to win their confidence
it will be an easy matter for them to dispense
with me. I am not commissioned as a leader by any
constituted authority. But as what power and influence
I have depend entirely upon the good will and
confidence of the people who choose to recognize me
as a leader, and listen to my advice, I am wholly in
their hands, and they can keep me or reject me any
day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly’s part in public affairs prior to 1872 had
been creditable and marked by ability, but there were
other public men who, in like circumstances, had
attained equal or greater distinction. In the year
1872 he was called upon to prove whether he was
endowed with that highest of all the gifts of Heaven,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
the capacity to lead men in a supreme emergency, and
it is not the language of eulogy to say that he displayed
consummate ability as such a leader; and that
his courage, coolness and good judgment enabled him
to achieve results which no other citizen of New York,
with similar resources at command, and similar
obstacles in his way, could have accomplished.</p>

<br>

<p>In a city of a million inhabitants, where a Government
had prevailed for years, such as disgraced Rome
in the days of Caligula, when the tyrant made his
horse a Roman Consul; or in the epoch from Tiberius
to Nero, when folly, crime and profligacy ran riot in
all departments of the Empire, such as Tacitus describes
so vividly in the Annals, and in the immortal
Life of Agricola; in such a state of affairs it was an
enormous task for John Kelly to head a successful
movement against a Ring intrenched in office, with
millions of stolen money at command, and backed up
by a purchased Legislature. This task he undertook
and accomplished, and history will record the fact on
its imperishable page that the gallant attack upon the
Ring in the Courts and Legislature, by Charles O’Conor
and Samuel J. Tilden, was not crowned with final success
until John Kelly carried the war into Tammany
Hall, and drove the Ring politicians from its portals.
O’Conor and Tilden scotched the snake in 1871,
and John Kelly killed it in 1872. Tammany Hall,
the cradle of American Democracy, whose patriotic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>Sachems in the year 1819 were addressed in a speech
by Andrew Jackson,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and in long friendly letters at
the same period by Thomas Jefferson, the elder Adams,
and James Madison,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> was rescued from disgrace and
placed again in control of honest men in 1872 by John
Kelly. Not only the political organization, but the
Tammany Society was wrested from the control of the
Ring. No political contest in the history of the city
of New York was more stubbornly fought on both
sides, or has been followed by happier results to the
people at large. If great public service entitles a man
to rank among the worthies of the Republic, John
Kelly won that title when he succeeded in expelling
the Ring men from Tammany Hall. His victory
marked an epoch. The Board of Sachems of the
Tammany Society for 1871, and the Board for 1872
tell the story of this great revolution:</p>

<p>On the retirement of Mr. Belmont from the Chairmanship
of the National Democratic Committee, in
1872, that distinguished position was tendered to Mr.
Kelly at the meeting of the National Convention in
Baltimore. But domestic affliction had again visited
him about that time, in the death in New York of
his only surviving daughter, his elder daughter having
died some time before in a city in Spain, where
her father had taken her in a vain pursuit of health.
Cast down by these afflictions, Mr. Kelly declined the
Chairmanship of the National Committee of his party,
but suggested his old friend Mr. Schell, who was
elected Chairman. “Who is John Kelly?” asked
some of the younger delegates at Baltimore, when
they heard his name mentioned as their first choice by
the New York delegation. They were informed by
Mr. Schell that Mr. Kelly was detained at home in
the house of mourning, but that he was a great leader
in New York politics, and a true patriot in public life;
and that he had sat in Congress before many of those
young men were well out of the nursery.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the Committee of Seventy
set out to reform the city government, but those
worthy old gentlemen soon became engaged in an
amusing scramble for office, and beyond putting their
chairman, General Dix, in the Governor’s chair, and
another of their number, Mr. Havemeyer, in that of
Mayor, they did not set the river on fire, nor perform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
any of the twelve labors of Hercules. As soon as the
Committee of Seventy became known as office-seekers,
their usefulness was at an end. John Kelly sought no
office, for he had to fight a battle with office-holders,
then a synonym for corruptionists, and he appreciated
the magnitude of the struggle more correctly than to
leave it in anybody’s power to say that the Ring men
and the Reform element, the latter marshalled by
Tilden and himself, were fighting over the offices. A
mere scramble for office between the Ins and Outs is
always a vulgar thing. When they became place-hunters,
the Committee of Seventy ceased to be reformers.
Kelly, with better statesmanship, sought
no office, and would accept none. When every other
event in his life has been forgotten, his memorable
battle in the County Convention of 1872 will still
be remembered. A fiercer one was never fought
in American politics. To employ the words of Mr.
Tilden, in his history of the overthrow of the Tammany
Ring, Kelly had to confront on that occasion,
“an organization which held the influence growing
out of the employment of twelve thousand
persons, and the disbursement of thirty millions a
year; which had possession of all the machinery of
local government, dominated the judiciary and police,
and swayed the officers of election.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Harry Genet was leader of the Ring men in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
Convention. Prize-fighters and heelers swarmed
upon the floor; and when Samuel B. Garvin was
again placed in nomination for District-Attorney, the
fighters and heelers roared themselves hoarse with
applause. Mr. Kelly took the floor to oppose Garvin,
when he was interrupted by Genet. He replied to
the latter in scathing language, arraigned him and
Garvin with the utmost severity, and although hissed
by the hirelings of the Ring, and interrupted by
volleys of oaths, John Kelly kept the mob in sufficient
restraint until he caught the eye of the chairman,
and moved an adjournment to 3 o’clock the
next day. Mr. Schell, who was in the chair, put
the motion to adjourn, and it was carried, in spite of
the protests of the mob.</p>

<p>The next day the same emissaries of the Ring were
there to overwhelm the Convention again, but this
time Kelly was prepared for them. He had a force
stationed at the doors of Tammany Hall, and no man,
not a delegate to the Convention, and not provided with
a delegate’s ticket, was allowed to enter the building.
The police and city authorities were on the side of the
desperadoes, but no policeman was allowed inside the
premises. This bold stand of Mr. Kelly had the desired
effect. By his personal intrepidity, and readiness
to resist attack, he cowed the rowdies, and no others
but delegates got into the Convention. Garvin was
defeated, and Charles Donohue was nominated for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
District-Attorney. Abram R. Lawrence was nominated
for Mayor. It was in that day’s struggle that
the backbone of the Ring was broken, and it ceased to
be a compact organization, and melted away after that
day’s defeat. Havemeyer of the Committee of Seventy
was elected Mayor, with Lawrence a close second, and
O’Brien a bad third. Phelps beat Donohue for District-Attorney.
But Reformed Tammany, in spite of
predictions to the contrary, polled a surprisingly large
vote, and although it did not elect, it was a vote of
confidence in John Kelly, and discerning men saw
that the future belonged to the old organization. Mr.
Havemeyer, who had been an excellent Mayor in early
life, now proved a failure. His defiance of the Supreme
Court in the case of Police Commissioners Charlick and
Gardner raised a storm of indignation about his head,
and led to his reprimand by Governor Dix, who threatened
his removal from office. Charlick and Gardner
had been indicted for a violation of the election laws,
and Mr. Kelly was very active in bringing on their
trial. They were convicted by the Jury, and sentenced
by Judge Brady to pay a fine of $250 each, but conviction
carried with it a still severer penalty, forfeiture
of their offices and disability to fill them by reappointment.
The Mayor’s attempt to reappoint them was
an act of surprising folly, but when the Governor’s
reprimand reached him, with the statement that his
age, and near completion of his term of office, alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
saved him from removal for contumacy, Mayor Havemeyer’s
rage vented itself in an extravagantly abusive
attack on John Kelly. He held Mr. Kelly responsible
for the trial of Charlick and Gardner, and after astounding
the community by defying the Supreme Court
with a vain attempt to re-instate the guilty officials,
he brought the matter to an impotent conclusion by
pouring out a torrent of abuse upon John Kelly, and
assailing his record for honesty when he was Sheriff of
New York. During all the long years which had
elapsed since Mr. Kelly had held that office, not one
syllable had ever been uttered derogatory to his exalted
character for honesty as Sheriff, until Mayor Havemeyer
made his reckless charges. Smarting under a
sense of humiliation after the Gardner-Charlick fiasco,
the Mayor allowed bad temper to get the mastery of
his judgment, and the explosion of wrath against Mr.
Kelly followed. The animus of the attack was perfectly
apparent on its face, and the good sense of the
people was not imposed upon by the revengeful
ebullitions of the angry old gentleman. Mr. Kelly
promptly instituted a suit for damages, but on the
very day the trial began, by a remarkable coincidence
Mayor Havemeyer, stricken by apoplexy, fell dead in
his office. The passionate events of the moment
were forgotten, and a sense of sorrow pervaded the
community. Mr. Havemeyer’s long and honorable
career was remembered, and the unfortunate passage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
in his last days was generally, and justly imputed
to the misguided counsels of his friends.</p>

<p>The Tammany Democrats were completely victorious
at the election of 1873. Those able lawyers,
Charles Donohue and Abram R. Lawrence, were
elected to the Supreme Court. The late William
Walsh and the late Wm. C. Connor, both excellent
men, were elected County Clerk and Sheriff. Again,
in 1874, victory perched on the standards of Mr.
Kelly. This time its dimensions were larger. In
addition to a Mayor (Mr. Wickham), and other city
officers, a Governor (Mr. Tilden), and other State officers,
were chosen by overwhelming Democratic majorities.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly had been the first man to suggest Mr.
Tilden’s nomination for Governor. His splendid services
in the war on the Ring pointed him out as the
fit candidate of his party. Tired out, after his long
labors, Mr. Tilden, in 1874, went to Europe to enjoy
the first holiday he had allowed himself for years.
But such was his confidence in the judgment of Mr.
Kelly, that a cable message from that friend was
sufficient to cause him to cancel his engagements in
Europe, give up his tour, and take passage in the
first steamer for New York. The Canal Ring was in
motion against Tilden’s nomination, and Kelly, who
had found this out, thought there was no time for
delay. Tilden at first expressed disinclination for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
office, but the Tammany Chief had set his heart on his
nomination, and the author of these pages has heard
Mr. Tilden say that Mr. Kelly’s persistency finally controlled
his decision, and won his acquiescence. One
of the leading delegates to the Convention of 1874
was Mr. William Purcell, editor of the <cite>Rochester
Union</cite>. “To John Kelly,” said Purcell editorially,
shortly after the election, “more than any other
man does Governor Tilden owe his nomination and
his majority at the election. Governor Tilden was
personally present at the nominating convention, in
close counsel with Mr. Kelly, than whom he lauded
no man higher for his personal honesty, his political
integrity, and his purity of purpose.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tilden was a constant visitor at Mr. Kelly’s house
during this period, and no two men could have evinced
more respect and friendship for each other. The last
time Mr. Tilden attended a meeting in Tammany Hall
was at the election of Sachems on the third Monday of
April, 1874. The late Matthew T. Brennan and
others ran an opposition or anti-Kelly ticket, and so
anxious was Mr. Tilden for the defeat of this movement
that he came down to the Wigwam, and took
an active part in favor of the regular ticket. He sat
with Mr. Kelly, and when the result was announced
warmly congratulated him upon the victory.</p>

<p>In the latter part of January, 1875, a few weeks
after Mr. Tilden’s inauguration as Governor, the author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
spent a morning at his residence in Gramercy Park,
and there met ex-Governor Seymour and Mr. Kelly,
in company with Governor Tilden. The conversation
of these three distinguished men, in the abandon
of social intercourse around the hearthstone of Gramercy
Park, was very agreeable and entertaining. The
author was an attentive listener and observer, and
afterwards, on the same day, wrote out in his diary
his impressions of these three celebrated New Yorkers.
Although ten years have elapsed since those impressions
were written, they are here reproduced in the
exact words in which they were then put down in the
diary, without the alteration of a single sentence:</p>

<p>[Conversed with Messieurs Seymour, Tilden and
Kelly at 15 Gramercy Park to-day. Big fellows all
of them, but entirely distinct types. Let me see if
I can depict them.</p>

<p>Horatio Seymour is a man well advanced in life,
tall, well-shaped, though rather spare in build, with a
beaming open countenance, a bright speaking eye,
expressive mouth and a large nose. The marks and
lines of the face and forehead are deep and strong.
His language is quite Saxon in its selection and character,
words of one or two syllables prevailing. His
expression of thought was clear enough to be taken
down by a stenographer as prepared utterances. His
range of subjects is large, and his treatment of each
ready and versatile. It is conversation all the time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
not platform or stump-speaking. The fault with him
seems to be one which any person of such eminent
parts might be liable to—it is an occasional tendency
to diffusion, a Narcissus-like disposition to dwell on
the shadow mirrored in the wave; not vanity, but an
introspective play of thought. His mental bent is
speculative, which perhaps accounts for his sometimes
presenting a thought under a great variety of aspects.
He throws out an opinion, and follows it up by a profusion
of suggestive considerations. Instead, however,
of pausing after the stroke was dealt, he would now
and again keep on elaborating his points until the
conversation began to expand into a disquisition. The
key remained conversational still, while the range was
widening. But let an interruption occur, and the
ex-Governor knew how to conclude with a hasty
stroke or two. His descriptive power is good, but
not so good as his reach and closeness of observation
into general principles, and his capacity to grasp and
develop causes and effects. He is more of a philosopher
than a delineator, and has humor too, which
draws the laugh at will.</p>

<p>Governor Tilden is a spare, close-cut man, of rather
a nautical appearance. You might mistake him in a
crowd for a weather-beaten old tar retired from the
deck of a man-of-war, to enjoy a little needed repose.
His movements and quiet speech suggest the idea to a
stranger of a cold, formal, negative man, reticent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
receptive, and not easily to be enlisted in ordinary
matters. Five minutes conversation with him will
suffice to upset such an opinion. First you will most
probably be struck with his eyes, which have an indefinable
expression. It would be spectral, if it were not
now melancholy, and again indicative of a womanly
tenderness. There is a peculiar play in them which
expresses a great deal. His voice is low, and one
might suppose, till he begins to converse, that he is a
better listener than talker. The forehead is gnarled
and concentrated, and on phrenological principles
would not indicate a marked presence of the intellectual
faculties, considered by itself; but if you draw
an imaginary line from the tip of the ears across the
head, it is evident that the brain power from the
brows to this line is proportionately very large, and
phrenologically very strong. His nose is a decided
aquiline, the mouth full but compressed, and the chin
prominent, and indicative of a marked preponderance
of the vital forces. His conversation is more nervous
than Seymour’s, but not so copious. He seems better
pleased with the suggestion than elaboration of ideas.
He can, however, when you don’t want to talk but to
listen, throw an analytical strength into his expressions
which sustains his reputation for sagacity and vigor.
Governor Tilden is classical in diction. The right word
is used all the time, although not a shadow of art is perceptible
in the language. He seems bent on convincing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
you by what he has to say, and not by his manner
of saying it. His method of reasoning is logical
and exhaustive, and yet it is analytical and not synthetical.
He leaves his listener to draw conclusions. He
is less given to generalization than to subtle methods
of mastering subjects. He has a quiet way of talking,
and of saying trenchant, sententious things. Governor
Tilden strikes me as a man who would be very slow to
gain popularity by dash of manners or exterior conduct,
but as having grit in him, and a genius for
accomplishing what he undertakes. He is already
named in several quarters as a prominent Democratic
candidate for the next Presidency.</p>

<p>John Kelly, leader of Tammany Hall, remains to be
described. He is a very different man from Seymour
or Tilden. An English traveler once heard Daniel
Webster on the stump in an interior New England
town. As he gazed at “Black Dan” with his massy
brows playing with ponderous thought, and his great
arm and big body swaying back and forth in obedience
to the ideas he was expressing, the first impression of
the Englishman was: “Why this man Webster, with
his herculean frame and sledge-hammer fist, would
have proved the most formidable gladiator that ever entered
the arena—if Providence had not given him a still
bigger head than body. He is a magnificent creature
considered as an animal, but a still more magnificent
man.” Kelly answers this description. The New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
York <cite>Herald</cite> once compared him to General Grant on
account of his quiet manners and reticence. He
stands two or three inches under six feet, weighs about
two hundred and thirty or forty pounds, is active and
firm in step and movement, and from his leonine aspect
must be the envy of those who delight in the manly art of
self-defence. His forehead is massive and broad, with a
wealth of phrenological development; over his physiognomy
are the lines of decision and benevolence of
character. The under jaw is large and firmly set, imparting
to his face an air of command and resolution.
In conversation he is modest and direct, and seldom
speaks of himself. That he is a man of action is at
once revealed to the observer. He has humor and a
keen appreciation of the amusing side of human nature.
His manners are quiet and frank, but underneath there
is discernible a cool and commanding spirit. A mingled
air of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhommie</i> and sternness proclaims to all that
he knows how to command obedience as well as respect,
and if once fairly aroused no man can confront an
enemy with sterner mien, or more annihilation in his
glance. Those who have seen him in stormy public
place, where such qualities alone avail, have often witnessed
this quiet man’s transformation into the fiery
ruler of his fellows.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>]</p>

<p>The extraordinary victories of the Tammany Democracy
for several years after Mr. Kelly became its leader,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
at length aroused jealousies and rivalries, and it began
to look as though the successful leader had enemies in
Printing-house Square. Perhaps the editors thought
they should have been consulted more frequently in
regard to nominations and other matters, and perhaps
Mr. Kelly made a mistake in not oftener seeking their
advice. At all events, an animated newspaper fire was
opened upon him in 1875. He was called a boss, a dictator;
“one man power” was furiously denounced;
and so savage was this onslaught, that if the editors
had not modified their expressions after election, and
even begun again to speak handsomely of him, one
might have imagined that John Kelly was a veritable
Ogre, a lineal successor to Tweed, instead of the
destroyer of Tweedism. But it was all only a custom
of the country at elections, and not an expression of
the editorial conscience. No man occupying a high
place ever escapes these fusillades; John Kelly formed
no exception to the invariable rule. At the election
of that year the Tammany ticket was badly defeated.
Replying to these denunciations against the Tammany
Chief, Mr. Abram S. Hewitt, then Chairman of the
General Committee of the Tammany Democracy, made
a speech, October 30, 1875, in the course of which he
said:</p>

<p>“The assertion that John Kelly is a dictator is an
insult to Tammany and its members. All organizations
must have leaders, and no one but John Kelly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
could have done the work that he has performed. The
city of New York owes to that calumniated man
honors that statues could not adequately pay. There
is no desire in John Kelly’s breast so strong as to be
relieved from his present onerous position but if some
one of respectability was not found to do such labors,
the city of New York would be soon as uninhabitable
as a den of wild beasts.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>One of the shrewdest political observers who has
figured during recent years in New York politics, was
the late Hugh J. Hastings, editor of the <cite>Commercial
Advertiser</cite>. As a Republican he was opposed to
Democrats, but he had the blunt candor to speak of
John Kelly in the following manner:</p>

<p>“On the ruins of Tweed rose Kelly, of Tammany
Hall, and Tilden, Hewitt, and Cooper joined his Court,
and were numbered among his legions. Under Kelly
the condition of society has improved in the city, and
we might add the municipal government,—all know
there was great room for improvement. Kelly has
ruled the fierce Democracy in such a manner that life
and property are comparatively safe. It is a fearful
responsibility to hold this wild element in check.
Beasts of burden may easily be managed by a new
master. But will the wild ass submit to the bonds?
Will the unicorn serve and abide his crib? Will the
leviathan hold out his nostrils to the hook? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
mythological conqueror of the East, whose enchantments
reduced wild beasts to the tameness of domestic
cattle, and who harnessed lions and tigers to his chariot,
is but an imperfect type of the man who can control
the wild, whiskey-drinking and fierce spirits that make
up the worst elements of this great city. It requires
a great man to stand between the City Treasury and
this most dangerous mass. It demands courage,
activity, energy, wisdom, or vices so splendid and alluring
as to resemble virtues. Again we say, dethrone
Kelly, and where is the man to succeed him?”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The spirit of faction, the curse of New York politics
from the beginning of the century, was again distracting
the Democratic party. New York and Albany
are natural political antagonists, as were Carthage and
Rome of old.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Conventions of 1821 and 1846,
by enlarging the elective features of government, had
greatly relieved New York, and greatly diminished
the power of the Albany Regency, but the love of power
is inbred in man, and special legislation at the State
capital still holds the giant metropolis in political leading
strings. During Mr. Tilden’s administration as
Governor, he and his old friend Mr. Kelly became involved
in unfortunate differences as leaders of rival
wings of the Democratic party of the State. It were
useless here to recapitulate the story of this disastrous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
breach between two statesmen who had done so much
when acting together to purify the public service; each
occupying the place he held at the wish, and by the
powerful assistance of the other; Kelly in Tammany
at Tilden’s urgent request, and Tilden called back from
Europe by a cable dispatch from Kelly to run for
Governor of New York. It were worse than useless
to revive the bitter memories of the strife. Let them
be buried in oblivion. A few weeks before the St.
Louis Convention in 1876, Mr. Tilden called upon Mr.
Kelly, and talked over old times. Before leaving, the
Governor humorously remarked:</p>

<p>“Now John, you are my sponsor, or political godfather.
You found me not inclined to take any office
two years ago, and you insisted that I should take the
nomination for Governor. No matter what differences
may have arisen since, remember John, you are my
sponsor.” Mr. Kelly smiled, but was non-committal.
But that visit, and graceful reminiscence of a happier
day in their political lives did its work well. Let
the brilliant Philadelphia editor, Alexander McClure,
tell the sequel. In a letter to his paper from St. Louis,
announcing Mr. Tilden’s nomination for the Presidency,
Mr. McClure said:</p>

<p>“The work of the Convention was then done, but
it was electrified by the appearance on the main aisle
of the full-moon, Irish face of John Kelly, the Anti-Tilden
Tammany Sachem. Those who hissed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
howled at him yesterday, now greeted him with thunders
of approval, and called him to the platform.
When he appeared there a whisper could have been
heard in any part of the hall, and when he gave in his
adhesion to Tilden and Hendricks, and pledged his
best efforts for their election, he was crowned and welcomed
as the returning prodigal of the household.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Right nobly did John Kelly keep that pledge.
Rutherford B. Hayes came in from the rural districts
of New York 30,000 ahead of Samuel J. Tilden.
When he reached the Harlem River he found that
Tammany Hall had given Mr. Tilden 54,000 majority
in the city of New York, and had wrested the Empire
State from the Republicans. President-elect Tilden
sent a message of congratulation on that memorable
election night to John Kelly, and his warmest salutations
to the invincible tribe of Saint Tammany, as
“the right wing of the Democratic Army.”</p>

<p>By changing dates and names, it will be found
that Mr. Kelly’s services in the Cleveland campaign
of 1884 were an exact repetition of his services
in 1876. He gave the same loyal support to Grover
Cleveland that he had given to Samuel J. Tilden.
He held his forces in hand magnificently, and if
the high honor may be attributed to any one man
of carrying New York through the most desperate
conflict ever waged within her borders, safely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
out of the very jaws of defeat, to the Democratic
column, that honor belongs to Honest John Kelly. To
save Grover Cleveland, Kelly sacrificed every man on
his local ticket, every dear friend who bore the Tammany
standards on that eventful day, which decided
the destinies of the United States for the next four
years.</p>

<p>When John Kelly was appointed Comptroller of the
City of New York by Mayor Wickham, in 1876, the
debt of the municipality which had been uniformly
accumulating under his predecessors until it reached
over a hundred million of dollars, was first arrested
in its upward course, and brought into a line of rapid
reduction. In four brief years he had reduced the debt
$12,000,000, thus justifying the encomiums of the press
at the time of his accession to the office. The New
York <cite>Herald</cite> of December 8, 1876, the day after his
appointment, said editorially:</p>

<p>“Mr. Kelly will make a very good Comptroller. He
has firmness, honesty and business capacity. He is the
right man in the right place, and a great improvement
on Mr. Green. He will guard the treasury just as
jealously as the present Comptroller, without being impracticable,
litigious and obstructive. The people of
New York will be satisfied with Mr. Kelly.”</p>

<p>The New York <cite>World</cite> of the same date, after dwelling
editorially upon his great ability, said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Kelly’s honesty and integrity are unquestioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
even by his bitterest political opponents. He is a native
of New York city. Beginning life as a mechanic,
by his energy and industry he very soon made himself
a manufacturer and a merchant. He sat for one term
in the Board of Aldermen, and was twice elected to
Congress. At Washington he handled questions of
national importance with ability and decorum, and by
the force of his native good sense soon took rank above
many men who had more experience than he in the
national councils. He is best known to New Yorkers
of the present day as the leader of the Tammany organization,
as the man who took hold of that ancient
society after it had been deservedly defeated, disgraced
and overthrown under the management of members
of the old Ring. He reorganized it, filled it with new
life, and weeded out the men who helped to bring reproach
upon it. The property-holders and taxpayers
of this city are to be congratulated that the administration
of their financial affairs has fallen into such
worthy hands, and will be entrusted to a man of Mr.
Kelly’s perspicacious brain and known probity.”</p>

<p>The New York <cite>Evening Express</cite>, of the same date,
referred to Mr. Kelly’s eminent fitness for the office,
and to his services in the election of Mr. Tilden to the
Presidency, and said, editorially: “Speaking in a political
sense only, Mr. Kelly has well earned this office,
and even a higher one, for to him more than any other
man is the credit due for the immense Democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
majority in this city, which gave the state to Governor
Tilden.”</p>

<p>The New York <cite>Sun</cite>, of the same date, said editorially:</p>

<p>“Mr. Kelly is an honest and capable man, willing
to do a great deal of hard work, well fitted to look
after the important and varied business of his office,
and the financial interests of the city. He is the most
popular man of the party that governs this city, and
stands well with the community at large. He will
make a good Comptroller. When the nomination of
Governor Tilden was made in St. Louis Mr. Kelly
promised to do all in his power to insure the success
of the people’s choice. During the campaign Mr.
Kelly’s labors were arduous and continuous. He gave
time and strength and money, and even deferred his
marriage until the fight should be over. That Mr.
Kelly might have secured the Mayoralty or any other
local office for himself, had he so desired, is no secret.
That he was urged against his will to take the Comptrollership
is asserted by his friends as a fact.”</p>

<p>An interesting event in Mr. Kelly’s life is incidentally
alluded to by Mr. Dana in the preceding article
from the <cite>Sun</cite>. This was his second marriage, which
took place on the 21st of November, 1876. His wife
is an accomplished lady in every sense of the word, the
good helpmeet, such as the Scripture describes. The
following, account of the wedding, is taken from the
New York <cite>World</cite>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>

<p>“As announced in <cite>The World</cite> of yesterday, promptly
at the hour of 8 in the morning, the ceremonies began
that were to end in the marriage of Mr. John Kelly to
Miss Teresa Mullen, a niece of Cardinal McCloskey.
About 7.30 the very few who were to participate in the
event assembled at Cardinal McCloskey’s house in
Madison avenue, where, in the private chapel of His
Eminence, the marriage was to take place. This alone
was a compliment of the highest order in Church etiquette,
doubtless owing to the relationship of the
bride to His Eminence. The little company invited
to witness the ceremony was gathered together in the
parlor of the mansion. The party consisted, besides
Mr. Kelly, of Mr. Francis D. Cleary, brother-in-law of
the bride; Mr. Edward L. Donnelly, Colonel George
W. Wingate, and Mr. Kelly’s nephew, Hugh Kelly.
Above stairs was assembled the bride with her two
sisters, Mrs. Francis D. Cleary and Miss Mullen. At
the hour appointed the Rev. Father Farley made his
appearance at the parlor door, and announced that all
was ready. The gentlemen at once arose and proceeded
to the chapel on the third floor, Mr. Kelly and Father
Farley being last. On the way to the chapel Mr. Kelly
was joined by the bride, and, arm in arm, the couple
slowly passed up to the double <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prie-Dieu</i>, before the
altar under the escort of Father Farley. Meantime
all had taken their respective positions in the beautiful
little chapel, in the order peculiar to Catholic Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
etiquette. All knelt in silent prayer for some few moments,
when the venerable Cardinal made his appearance,
preceded by the Rev. Father Farley, Very Rev.
Vicar-General Quinn, and one handsome little boy
dressed like a miniature Cardinal, who acted as candle-bearer
to His Eminence.</p>

<p>“The Cardinal in his scarlet robes then took his place
before the altar, with the Vicar-General to his right,
and Father Farley and the acolyte to his left. Immediately
behind His Eminence knelt the future husband
and wife, side by side. After a moment’s silent
prayer the Cardinal began the services. Laying off
the mozetta, the Vicar-General and Father Farley enrobed
His Eminence. The amice, alb, cincture, pectoral
cross, stole, cope and mitre having been placed
upon his head and shoulders, the Cardinal turned to
perform the marriage ceremony. The vestments worn
were white and gold. The ring was blessed, and the
Cardinal said: ‘John Kelly, do you take this woman
to be your lawful wife?’</p>

<p>‘I do.’</p>

<p>‘Do you promise to love and cherish her until
death?’</p>

<p>‘I do.’ And so likewise vowed Teresa Mullen to
love and honor John Kelly until death.</p>

<p>“A few more prayers, and His Eminence turned from
the kneeling couple, leaving them man and wife. The
crozier, mitre and cope were laid aside; and His Eminence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
putting on the chasuble, commenced the nuptial
Mass, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro sponsis</i>. The gospel of the Mass is the recital
of the marriage of Canaan, when Christ changed
the water into wine. The Mass progressed slowly to
the communion, when the newly-married received
the Sacrament. Just after the <em>Pater Noster</em>, the two
kneeling on the step of the altar, His Eminence read
from the missal, with mitre on head, the long prayer
imploring from God harmony and peace in the domestic
relations of the newly-married, and praying that if
God should bless them with children, they might be
brought up in the fear of the Lord. This over, the
Mass soon ended. After the Mass the little congregation
and the clergy withdrew, leaving the Cardinal,
and Mr. and Mrs. Kelly together. A few kind words
of encouragement, and advice, and congratulations were
administered by the Cardinal; and, while he remained
to say a few prayers, Mr. and Mrs. Kelly joined their
friends, and received their well wishes.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In concluding this volume the author regrets that
he has not found room for more of Mr. Kelly’s
speeches. They are all full of good sense, and occasionally
they display a high order of eloquence. The
present plan did not admit of their introduction. One,
however, must be included, as it illustrates the witty
side of his character, and was spoken of by those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
heard it as a very happy after-dinner speech. It was
made before the Lotos Club, January 11, 1879, at the
dinner given to Mayor Cooper, soon after that gentleman
had entered upon his duties as Mayor of the city
of New York.</p>

<p>The following is the report in the <cite>Herald</cite> of January
12, 1879:</p>

<p>“The seating capacity of the large dining room of
the Lotos Club was taxed to the utmost last evening.
Mayor Cooper, and the retiring Mayor, Smith Ely, Jr.,
being the guests of the club. About ninety members
and guests found seats at the tables, and nearly as
many more, who were present during the delivery of
the speeches, had to content themselves with standing
room. Mr. Whitelaw Reid, president of the club,
presided at the middle table, and at the heads of the
upper and lower tables, respectively, sat the vice-presidents,
Noah Brooks and Dr. Charles J. Pardee.
Among the persons present as members or guests were
Postmaster James, Chauncey M. Depew, Augustus
Schell, John Kelly, Judge Noah Davis, Robert B.
Roosevelt, Peter Cooper, Charles H. Chapin, Paul Du
Chaillu, Dr. Isaac I. Hayes, Colonel Thomas W. Knox,
George Osgood, Frederick B. Noyes, Moses Mitchell,
Drs. Hammond, Arnold and Callen, and General
Barnum.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent fs90">COMPTROLLER KELLY’S SPEECH.</p>

<p>Mr. Kelly was very cordially greeted when, in answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
to a pressing call for ‘a few words,’ he rose to
speak.</p>

<p>“<em>Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Lotos Club:</em>—
I have read frequently in the papers of the Lotos
Club, but never before had even the honor to know
where it met after it left Irving Place, and when asking
to-night where the Lotos Club was, I was informed
that it was directly opposite the Union Club. I do
not know what progress the Lotos Club has made in
life since its organization, but certainly you are at a
point in this city—on Fifth avenue—where they say
the aristocracy live. If this is a specimen of the aristocracy
I am entirely content to mix with them at all
times. (Applause and laughter). As the president of
the Club has said, you have a mixture here of all kinds,
and that political discussions are never brought
among you. I will say that that is a very friendly
state of society when you can come together and talk
of everything but politics. I have always noticed in
life, particularly in public affairs, that the first topic
broached was politics, and it usually commenced by
abusing somebody. (Laughter). Now that has been
my misfortune. I got along very well in my early
political life. I had very little said against me, but
I found after a few years that I was about as bad a
fellow in the estimation of some people as could be
found in this community, or any other. (Laughter).
But it don’t worry me a bit. (Laughter). I have got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
to that state of mind that I feel if a man is conscious
that he is trying to do his best, as well as he can understand
it, he need care very little what may be said
about him. (Applause). A man’s conscience should
at all times be his master. (Applause). Now, I do not
think that politics should be brought into discussion
here. Mayor Cooper has a very important duty to
perform. Probably he can hardly realize yet the
amount of labor he must go through, and no man can
tell until he gets into the Mayor’s office. I suppose
our friend Ely here, when he first entered on his
duties, considered it a light place, but he was not there
long before he saw that the labor was immense. I do
not mean to say that the intellectual labor is immense,
but the responsibility connected with the office. I am
exceedingly anxious, so far as I am concerned, that
Mayor Cooper’s administration may be successful.
(Loud applause.) Mayor Cooper is not the representative
of a party; he leaves the party behind him.
And he undoubtedly will be successful, because I sincerely
believe that he has the full interest of the people
at heart, and that he will do his best to serve them.
(Applause.) I have said so since his election, and I
said so before his election. People have various
opinions about parties. Our friend Reid here sometimes
scolds, but probably if he knew the truth he
would not say such things about public officers as he
does. (Laughter.) I do not mean to say that he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
allow himself to be prejudiced or biased, but he will
get a notion in his head, and say, ‘That fellow is not
doing right, and I will take him to task for it,’ and
so he goes at it. (Laughter.) Mayor Cooper now has
the support of the press of this city, but he will
probably find that before the end of his term the press
will begin to find fault with him. Then Mayor
Cooper will say, ‘I have not done anything in particular
that I know of that they should abuse me. Damn
the fellow; I will go and see him.’ (Great laughter.)
I do not mean to say that Mr. Cooper will do that
either, because he is a very sensible man, but I know
that our friend Ely did it repeatedly. (Great laughter.)
I have often gone into his office after he came in in
the morning. He had read the papers at home, and
was full of them. Down he comes to the office, slaps
his hat on his head, and off he goes to the <cite>Times</cite>. The
<cite>Times</cite> man tells him, ‘Well, we will look into this
thing.’ (Laughter.) He has not got a satisfactory
answer from the <cite>Times</cite>, and off he starts for our friend
of the <cite>Tribune</cite>. Then Mr. Reid says, ‘Well, Mr. Ely,
I don’t know; there are various opinions about this
matter. I cannot give you a positive answer about
it. I will look into the thing, and let you know.’
(Laughter.) So, Ely goes the rounds. Back he comes
disconsolate. He says, ‘I have seen all these fellows
of the press, and they are all alike, they are abusing
me for nothing. They can’t do that. I have been in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
the leather business, and I refer them to that trade.
Go and ask Schultz; go and ask any fellow down in
the Swamp whether I ever took anything that didn’t
belong to me.’ (Laughter.) Then he becomes a
philosopher and says, ‘What is the use of talking?
They are only one man. Each controls his paper, and
has individual opinions. The ‘boys’ are with me.
(Loud laughter.) I will throw myself on the ‘boys.’
(Renewed laughter.) ‘They can say what they please
about me.’ After a few days pass down he comes to
the office again, and says, ‘The <cite>Times</cite> is raising the
devil this morning,’ and so the thing goes on.
(Laughter.) Now, gentlemen, I will say this. You
have a very large city. Some people in public office
must be censured. It is necessary, probably, sometimes
that they should be, for it often has a beneficial
effect. There is a large number of people who will
say that there has been no reform in the city government,
and will never take the trouble to find out
whether there is or not. During the time Mayor Ely
has been in office great progress has been made; but I
venture to say that, while the debt of the city has been
reduced $6,300,000 inside of two years, by the end of
the term of the present Mayor, if things should continue
in the same way, as there is no reason why they
should not, you will find that the debt will have been
reduced from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000. (Applause.)
That will be an accomplishment of $10,000,000 inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
of four years. (Applause.) Yes; I venture to say
that if I remain in office—whatever has occurred, let
that pass; I do not refer to it—but if he and I work
together in the interests of the city, the debt in the
next two years will be reduced $8,000,000. (Applause.)
I wish Mayor Cooper all the success in
public life that any friend of his can wish him, and I
assure him and his friends that so far as the official
business of this city is concerned, there will be no disagreement
between us on matters which are really in
the interest of the people. (Long continued applause.)</p>

<p>Speeches were made during the evening by Dr.
Isaac I. Hayes, Chauncey M. Depew, Robert B.
Roosevelt and Judge Noah Davis.”</p>

<p>As this volume goes to press Mr. Kelly, who has
been indisposed recently, is again recovering his
health. His severe labors in the recent Presidential
campaign brought on an attack of his old trouble of
insomnia. He is now steadily improving, and rides
horseback for one or two hours every day. Referring
to his sickness, the New York <cite>Times</cite> of December 12,
1884, contained the following remarks:</p>

<p>“The substantial shoes of Mr. John Kelly stand unoccupied
in Mr. Kelly’s Sixty-ninth street mansion,
and their owner is taking all the ease which ill-health
and restlessness will admit of. Those shoes are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
object of a great deal of attention. In all the 50,000
voters in the Tammany Hall organization, there is not
one fit to succeed him as the head of the party.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <cite>Times</cite> might have added that there is no one
in Tammany Hall who desires to succeed Mr. Kelly,
and that he has held the leadership of that ancient
organization nearly five times as long as any other
leader in the whole history of Tammany. But there
are other men of no mean ability in the ranks of that
organization. They are all the friends, and not the
rivals, of the subject of this memoir.</p>

<p>The chief events of John Kelly’s past life are, at
least in outline, now before the reader. The task
which the author set out to perform is discharged,
to tell the truth about a distinguished citizen, and to
let him speak for himself, both in his public and
private career, during the past forty years.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mrs. Kelly, and two bright little children, a daughter
and son, have brought the sunlight back again to John
Kelly’s home, where, after this imperfect sketch of his
remarkable career, we leave him a happy man, and an
honored citizen.</p>
